    "content": "<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After experimenting with various AI assistants for coding and learning, I&#39;ve discovered that each serves a distinct purpose rather than forming a complementary set. Claude Code excels at codebase exploration but sacrifices user control, Solveit offers deep understanding at the cost of speed, Lumo provides a superior privacy-focused chat interface, whilst GitHub Copilot can be useful for code review and GitHub Actions. Rising subscription costs make hardware investments like Mac Mini or AMD Strix Halo increasingly attractive for running open-weight models.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Over the past year, I&#39;ve experimented with multiple AI development tools, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. My goal has been to find a minimal, effective toolstack that covers all my needs whilst reducing subscription costs. What I&#39;ve discovered is that each tool excels in specific domains rather than forming a truly complementary ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-current-toolstack\">My Current Toolstack</h2>\n<h3 id=\"claude-code-used-daily\">Claude Code (Used Daily)</h3>\n<p>Claude Code has become my primary workhorse for several key tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Codebase exploration</strong>: Navigating unfamiliar repositories and understanding other developers&#39; code</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-file fixes</strong>: Making coordinated changes across multiple files</li>\n<li><strong>Code documentation</strong>: Generating comprehensive documentation for existing code</li>\n<li><strong>Article drafting</strong>: Creating initial outlines like this one before manual refinement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While Claude Code excels at complex requirements and large codebases, its primary limitation is a lack of user control. The agentic AI takes charge of the coding process, often overcomplicating both code and text. I find myself regularly simplifying its output to match my preference for minimalist solutions.</p>\n<p>Claude Max x20 at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/anthropic-rolls-out-a-200-per-month-claude-subscription/\">$200/month</a> feels steep when a capable miniPC running open-weight models -<a href=\"https://openhands.dev/blog/minimax-m2-5-open-weights-models-catch-up-to-claude\">likely approaching Sonnet capability within 6 months</a>- costs similar money upfront. Open-weight models <a href=\"https://epoch.ai/data-insights/open-weights-vs-closed-weights-models\">typically lag frontier models by six months</a>, yet <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/24/1110526/china-deepseek-top-ai-despite-sanctions/\">accelerated releases from Chinese research groups</a> suggest this gap may narrow. An <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-ai-max-395-strix-halo-mini-pc-tested-powerful-apu-up-to-140w-power-128-gb-variable-memory-igpu/\">AMD Strix Halo system</a> might prove worthwhile for experimenting with powerful open-weight models rather than maintaining expensive subscriptions. At <a href=\"https://www.tweaktown.com/news/103292/amd-ryzen-ai-max-395-strix-halo-apu-mini-pc-tested-up-to-140w-power-128gb-of-ram/index.html\">~140W power consumption</a>, even running 24/7, electricity costs remain manageable compared to subscription fees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"github-copilot-used-occasionally\">GitHub Copilot (Used Occasionally)</h3>\n<p>Copilot occupies an interesting position in my workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inline code suggestions</strong>: Useful for repetitive patterns and common operations</li>\n<li><strong>GitHub Actions workflows</strong>: Strong at suggesting CI/CD configurations</li>\n<li><strong>Documentation generation</strong>: Reasonable at generating docstrings, doctests and comments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, I&#39;ve found Copilot frequently gets in my way, offering suggestions when I don&#39;t need them and sometimes requiring more effort to correct than to write from scratch. Of all my current tools, Copilot provides the least unique value given its overlap with other assistants.</p>\n<h3 id=\"protons-lumo-used-occasionally\">Proton&#39;s Lumo (Used Occasionally)</h3>\n<p>Lumo has become a great helping hand, with strong privacy guarantees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refining ideas</strong>: Excellent conversational partner for brainstorming and iteration</li>\n<li><strong>Small code snippets</strong>: Generates concise, practical solutions without overengineering</li>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT alternative</strong>: A smooth, privacy-focused chat interface</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What sets Lumo apart is Proton&#39;s commitment to privacy. Unlike many AI tools, Lumo operates with a strict no-logs policy and zero-access encryption, ensuring conversations remain confidential. </p>\n<p>I&#39;m looking forward to the potential of Proton releasing an API for Lumo, which might eventually allow it to serve as a replacement for other AI services in some contexts. However, there&#39;s no guarantee this will happen as the company may have different plans for its development.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solveit-used-daily\">Solveit (Used Daily)</h3>\n<p>I&#39;m still exploring Solveit&#39;s capabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Literate programming</strong>: Integrates documentation and code development seamlessly</li>\n<li><strong>Learning new domains</strong>: Particularly strong for building Python projects from scratch</li>\n<li><strong>Book chapter writing</strong>: Structured approach to technical content creation</li>\n<li><strong>Close reading</strong>: Deep dive into research papers, books, blog posts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What makes Solveit distinctive is its methodical approach based on George Polya&#39;s classic problem-solving framework from his 1945 book &quot;<em>How to Solveit</em>&quot;. Instead of generating large blocks of code, Solveit encourages building solutions incrementally -typically one or two lines at a time- maintaining human agency throughout the process.</p>\n<p>Unlike Claude Code&#39;s automated approach where the agentic AI takes control, Solveit keeps me firmly in the driver&#39;s seat whilst still providing AI assistance. This results in deeper understanding and learning, albeit at the cost of development speed. The platform&#39;s design as a &quot;dialogue engineering&quot; environment rather than just a code generator helps avoid the cognitive debt that can accumulate when over-relying on AI-generated content.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m actively evaluating whether Solveit could become my primary IDE for production code contributions, though its design scope may not fully extend to this use case yet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mistral-vibe-evaluated\">Mistral Vibe (Evaluated)</h3>\n<p>I evaluated Mistral&#39;s agentic AI CLI tool Mistral Vibe with Devstral-2 123B via API. The generous Le Chat Pro usage limits were welcome compared to Claude Pro&#39;s increasingly restrictive quotas.</p>\n<p>Mistral Vibe follows a similar approach to Claude Code -providing an agentic AI interface for coding tasks. The tool handled basic operations competently and showed decent understanding of project context. However, Devstral-2 feels noticeably weaker than Claude Sonnet and Opus in several key areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Code quality</strong>: Generated solutions were functional but less elegant</li>\n<li><strong>Context understanding</strong>: Struggled with complex multi-file relationships</li>\n<li><strong>Problem solving</strong>: Required more iterations to reach satisfactory solutions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the cost advantages are compelling, the capability gap made it unsuitable as a primary replacement for Claude Code in my workflow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finding-the-optimal-balance\">Finding the Optimal Balance</h2>\n<p>After several months of experimentation, I&#39;ve concluded that GitHub Copilot is the weakest link in my current stack. While I&#39;ve got an annual subscription, I&#39;ll limit its use to GitHub Actions and smaller GitHub issues.</p>\n<p>My evaluation of Mistral Vibe reinforced this assessment -despite generous usage limits, Devstral-2&#39;s capabilities lag noticeably behind Claude&#39;s models, making it unsuitable as a primary replacement despite potential cost savings.</p>\n<p>Rather than seeking an assortment of tools, I&#39;ve found that each tool serves a distinct purpose with its own strengths and trade-offs:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Task</th>\n<th>Current Best Tool</th>\n<th>Key Trade-off</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Codebase exploration</td>\n<td>Claude Code</td>\n<td>Sacrifices user control to agentic AI</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multi-file changes</td>\n<td>Claude Code</td>\n<td>May overcomplicate solutions</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chat interface/brainstorming</td>\n<td>Lumo</td>\n<td>Limited code integration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Privacy-focused interactions</td>\n<td>Lumo</td>\n<td>No API access (yet?)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep learning/controlled coding</td>\n<td>Solveit</td>\n<td>Slower development pace</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GitHub specific tasks</td>\n<td>GitHub Copilot</td>\n<td>Limited unique value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Production coding</td>\n<td>Still evaluating</td>\n<td>Control vs. speed</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>The bigger question may be sustainability. <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/pricing\">Claude Max&#39;s $200/month cost</a> competes directly with hardware investments like an AMD Strix Halo or a Mac Mini that could run increasingly capable open-weight models. If <a href=\"https://fourweekmba.com/the-open-model-convergence-how-the-frontier-gap-collapsed-to-6-months/\">open-weight models continue closing the gap</a> with frontier models -<a href=\"https://aarambhdevhub.medium.com/open-source-ai-vs-paid-ai-for-coding-the-ultimate-2026-comparison-guide-ab2ba6813c1d\">potentially within 6 months</a>- local hardware might offer better long-term value than subscription services.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m looking for a minimal, compact toolbox that covers my computational and learning requirements whilst remaining cost-effective as the AI landscape evolves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-path-forward\">The Path Forward</h2>\n<p>Each tool occupies a different niche in my workflow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Claude Code</strong> for tasks where I need to understand large codebases or make coordinated changes across multiple files, accepting some loss of control to agentic AI</li>\n<li><strong>Lumo</strong> for conversational interactions where privacy is paramount, especially when brainstorming sensitive topics</li>\n<li><strong>Solveit</strong> for deeper learning experiences and maintaining complete control of the code creation process</li>\n<li><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> for GitHub-specific tasks until my subscription expires</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unlike my initial assumption that tools would complement each other, I&#39;ve discovered they serve different use cases with distinct trade-offs between control, privacy, speed, and depth of understanding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The key insight from this exploration is that AI tools present distinct trade-offs rather than forming a complementary ecosystem. Each tool -Claude Code&#39;s agentic automation, Lumo&#39;s privacy-focused chat, Solveit&#39;s methodical learning approach, and Copilot&#39;s GitHub integration- serves specific use cases with inherent compromises between control, privacy, speed, and depth.</p>\n<p>My goal is to narrow down to two tools that best address my needs, reducing both subscription costs and cognitive overhead. The challenge isn&#39;t finding perfect complementarity, but identifying which specific trade-offs I&#39;m willing to accept for different types of work as the AI landscape continues evolving. Currently the combination of Claude Code and Solveit seems to strike the best balance for my needs.</p>\n"

    "url": "/posts/TIL-hybrid-rag.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) uses three main retrieval strategies: (1) Sparse retrieval (50 years old) relies on keyword matching via TF-IDF/BM25- excellent for exact matches but poor with synonyms; (2) Dense retrieval (5-10 years old) uses vector embeddings to capture semantic meaning- better for natural language but misses rare terms; (3) Hybrid retrieval (2-3 years old) combines both approaches with fusion algorithms to merge results. Hybrid retrieval is now the gold standard, balancing precision, recall, and processing speed for modern RAG systems.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nRAG Retrieval: The Key to Accurate AI Responses</h2>\n<p>\nThis post is based on a concise and informative video titled <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/watch?v=r0Dciuq0knU\">Hybrid RAG</a> from the IBM Technology YouTube channel. The video provides an excellent short introduction to what Hybrid RAG is.</p>\n<p>\nA RAG system’s effectiveness depends largely on its retrieval strategy- how it fetches information to feed into an LLM. The process works by:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nProcessing a user query  </li>\n  <li>\nRetrieving relevant chunks from a knowledge base  </li>\n  <li>\nFeeding those chunks to an LLM  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThe quality of retrieved information directly impacts the factual accuracy of the LLM’s responses.</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"/images/Hybrid%20RAG.png\" alt=\"Visual comparison of Sparse, Dense, and Hybrid RAG approaches\">\n</p>\n<p>\nLet’s explore the three major retrieval strategies:</p>\n<h2>\nSparse Retrieval: The Classic Approach (50 years old)</h2>\n<p>\n<strong>How it works</strong>: Uses keyword matching through TF-IDF and BM25, counting term frequency in documents and scoring accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nSimple and fast implementation  </li>\n  <li>\nHighly scalable  </li>\n  <li>\nCost-effective (no embeddings required)  </li>\n  <li>\nEffective for domain-specific terminology  </li>\n  <li>\nCan sometimes outperform complex models for specialised terms  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Cons</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nPoor with synonyms and related concepts  </li>\n  <li>\nLimited contextual understanding  </li>\n  <li>\nStruggles with conceptual queries  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Best uses</strong>: Scenarios requiring exact wording- short queries, code search, log analysis, legal clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Implementations</strong>: Elasticsearch, Apache Lucene, Milvus</p>\n<h2>\nDense Retrieval: The Semantic Workhorse (5-10 years old)</h2>\n<p>\n<strong>How it works</strong>: Maps queries and documents into vector space using embeddings (often called “vector search”), finding results based on semantic similarity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nStrong contextual understanding  </li>\n  <li>\nHandles synonyms and paraphrasing well  </li>\n  <li>\nFlexible for natural language queries  </li>\n  <li>\nCaptures content meaning effectively  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Cons</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nMisses rare terms and jargon  </li>\n  <li>\nLess effective for very short queries  </li>\n  <li>\nMore computationally intensive  </li>\n  <li>\nRequires domain adaptation  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Best uses</strong>: Chatbots, customer service, research over unstructured knowledge bases.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Implementations</strong>: Meta’s FAISS, JVector</p>\n<h2>\nHybrid Retrieval: The Current State of the Art (2-3 years old)</h2>\n<p>\n<strong>How it works</strong>: Combines vector-based and keyword-based search, processing queries through both methods and merging results.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pros</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nLeverages strengths of both approaches  </li>\n  <li>\nOutperforms dense-only retrieval in benchmarks  </li>\n  <li>\nImproves precision and recall metrics  </li>\n  <li>\nHandles both semantics and rare terms  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Fusion algorithms</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nWeighted sum (e.g., 70% dense, 30% sparse)  </li>\n  <li>\nReciprocal Ranked Fusion (RRF), merging based on ranked positions  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Best uses</strong>: Specialised domains (legal, technical, medical) and general-purpose retrieval requiring high accuracy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Implementations</strong>: Elasticsearch, Milvus, Weaviate, DataStax Astra DB</p>\n<h2>\nWhy Hybrid Retrieval Leads the Pack</h2>\n<p>\nIf sparse retrieval is fast but literal, and dense retrieval is contextually aware but misses specific terms, hybrid retrieval offers the best combination:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Complementary strengths</strong>: Semantic matching for concepts, keyword matching for critical terms  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Balanced performance</strong>: Optimises for speed, precision, and recall  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Adaptability</strong>: Works across different domains and query types  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Improved accuracy</strong>: Consistently outperforms single-method approaches  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nRetrieval strategies have evolved from simple keyword matching to sophisticated semantic understanding, with hybrid approaches now delivering superior results.</p>\n<p>\nFor RAG system developers today, hybrid retrieval offers the most balanced approach- combining the precision of keyword search with the contextual understanding of vector embeddings in a unified solution.</p>\n<p>\nThis TIL is based on the excellent explanation in IBM Technology’s video on Hybrid RAG, that’s worth your time in my opinion.</p>\n",

The most crucial insight: real breakthroughs come from researchers who ignore consensus, think for themselves, and tackle hard problems. Most encouragingly, they stress that anyone with determination can become an expert in this rapidly evolving field.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nIn a field evolving as rapidly as artificial intelligence, mid-career researchers often find themselves at a crossroads, balancing established expertise with the need to adapt to new paradigms. A recent compilation of advice from leading AI researchers and practitioners offers valuable insights for navigating this challenging terrain. These perspectives from industry leaders at organisations like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and others reveal common themes about what truly matters for success in AI research today- with surprising emphasis on coding skills, infrastructure knowledge, and the courage to challenge consensus.</p>\n<h2>\nKey Advice from Industry Leaders</h2>\n<p>\nBelow is <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/chrisbarber/status/1973405958786429285\">a collection of insights</a> from leading AI researchers and practitioners, in response to the question: “<em>What career advice do you have for AI researchers, or what you wish you’d learned earlier?</em>“:</p>\n<h3>\nDevelop Strong Coding Skills</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/jeremyphoward\">@jeremyphoward</a>, &gt; <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/answerdotai\">@answerdotai</a>, &gt; <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/fastdotai\">@fastdotai</a></strong> Mid-career AI researchers (in &gt; fact all levels!): focus on becoming really good coders. Learn to replicate &gt; interesting research papers from scratch. Code is the medium we use to &gt; experiment, so if you’re better at it, you can run more complex and creative &gt; experiments more quickly.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nPrioritise GPU Access</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/jacobmbuckman\">@jacobmbuckman</a>, Manifest AI</strong> Get as &gt; close to as many gpus as early as possible. Almost nothing else you could do &gt; is higher value.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nBuild, Don’t Just Study</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/rronak_\">@rronak_</a>, Google DeepMind</strong> Stop studying, &gt; build. Go one layer deeper into the infra than feels comfortable, since that’s &gt; where the value is. If you’re on Langchain, write the agent loop yourself; if &gt; you’re on Verl, write the pytorch yourself; If you’re on Megatron, write the &gt; cuda kernels yourself.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nEstablish Your Public Presence</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/finbarrtimbers\">@finbarrtimbers</a>, Ai2</strong> People need to &gt; know you exist to give you opportunities. Write about interesting ideas you &gt; have or things you are thinking about. There is an extreme hunger for &gt; “interesting lunch conversation at DeepMind” level content (not hype boi &gt; threads, not paper level technical).  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nFind Your Unique Perspective</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/_arohan_\">@<em>arohan</em></a>, Anthropic</strong> &gt; &gt; 1. Perspective matters more than novelty, many so-called ‘solved’ problems &gt;    still hide unsolved challenges in the details. Don’t dismiss anything as &gt;    trivial; breakthroughs are hidden in plain sight. &gt; 2. Don’t worry about pedigree or fitting in. Hinton bet on neural networks &gt;    when the field dismissed them. The real breakthroughs come from researchers &gt;    who ignore the consensus, think for themselves, and tackle hard problems- &gt;    and that researcher can be you.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nInvest in Foundational Knowledge</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/danielhanchen\">@danielhanchen</a>, Unsloth AI</strong> I would &gt; definitely watch MIT, Stanford videos much much earlier- &gt; <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOmsNzYBMe0gJY2XS8AQg16\">CS231N</a>, &gt; do <a href=\"https://course.fast.ai/\">FastAI courses</a>, &gt; <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI\">MIT’s AI course</a>, &gt; Gilbert Strang’s courses + &gt; <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLULjW8y9XZKiTBlTFPVDLebgtctNZCgG-\">CS229</a>.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<em>Note: For readers interested in Gilbert Strang’s courses, some excellent options include <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8\">MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra</a>, <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318\">Highlights of Calculus</a>, <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k\">MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods</a>, <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61iQEFiWLE21EJCxwmWvvek\">A Vision of Linear Algebra</a>, and <a href=\"https://yewtu.be/watch?v=UcWsDwg1XwM&list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318&index=1\">Big Picture of Calculus</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>\nTake Action and Be Selective</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/BlackHC\">@BlackHC</a>, Google DeepMind</strong> Something I tell &gt; people: Just try and do things, and if you’re in a place where you can’t &gt; innovate or learn, figure out whether to switch. Everything compounds, so it &gt; pays off long-term to be picky. Compromise compensation for role fit if &gt; necessary. Something I wish I had internalized earlier: When in doubt, double &gt; down and work hard. Nothing builds confidence and motivation like working &gt; harder and getting results.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nConnect with the Research Community</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/TianbaoX\">@TianbaoX</a>, OpenAI</strong> I wish I had learned &gt; earlier how important it is to actively exchange ideas with others and stay &gt; close to the frontier- AI is a fast-moving field, and working in isolation &gt; rarely leads to impact. Because scaling laws hold so strongly, incremental &gt; work often gets washed out; the real breakthroughs come from daring to imagine &gt; and build something fundamentally new.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nSeek Fulfilling Work</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/sandersted\">@sandersted</a>, OpenAI</strong> If you’re unhappy in &gt; a job, look for a better one.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>\nRemember Expertise Is Accessible</h3>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\n<strong><a href=\"https://xcancel.com/rolandgvc\">@rolandgvc</a>, xAI</strong> You’re 2 weeks away from &gt; catching up to the state of the art.

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Moving from Python to Rust for AI work requires a phased approach focusing on self-contained utilities first, leveraging PyO3 for hybrid integration, and adopting a minimal subset of Rust features before expanding. This strategy maintains productivity while gradually unlocking Rust’s type safety, performance, and cross-platform deployment advantages.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nAfter previously discussing the potential of doing AI and Data Science with <a href=\"https://ai-mindset.github.io/posts/deno.html\">Deno</a> or <a href=\"https://ai-mindset.github.io/posts/go-pragmatic-modern-development.html\">Go</a>, I’ve found Rust to be a compelling alternative, offering an ecosystem that covers my needs, memory safety without garbage collection, and a single-binary deployment model.\\ Four Rust libraries, namely</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://rig.rs/\">Rig</a> for LLM applications  </li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://docs.rs/ndarray/\">ndarray</a> for linear algebra  </li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://plotters-rs.github.io/home/\">plotters</a> for visualisation  </li>\n  <li>\n<a href=\"https://docs.pola.rs/\">Polars</a> for DataFrames\\    <br>\nalready cover 90+% of an AI Engineer’s and a Data Scientist’s needs.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nPhased Migration Strategy</h2>\n<p>\n<strong>1. Start with small, self-contained utilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nBegin by rewriting simple command-line tools or utilities  </li>\n  <li>\nFocus on pure functions with clear inputs/outputs  </li>\n  <li>\nExamples: data processors, validators, or simple APIs  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>2. Learn incrementally through practical patterns</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust\">// Python:\ndef process_data(items):\n    return [x * 2 for x in items if x &gt; 0]\n\n// Rust equivalent:\nfn process_data(items: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; Vec&lt;i32&gt; {\n    items.iter().filter(|x| **x &gt; 0).map(|x| x * 2).collect()\n}</code></pre>\n<p>\n<strong>3. Adopt a hybrid approach during transition</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nUse <a href=\"https://pyo3.rs/\">PyO3</a> to call your new Rust code from existing Python  </li>\n  <li>\nGradually replace performance-critical components first  </li>\n  <li>\nKeep Python for rapid prototyping until comfortable with Rust  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>4. Leverage familiar concepts across languages</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nRust’s iterators ≈ Python’s generators  </li>\n  <li>\nRust’s closures ≈ Python’s lambda functions  </li>\n  <li>\nRust’s Option/Result ≈ Python’s Optional/try-except  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nKeeping Rust Simple and Robust</h2>\n<p>\n<strong>1. Start with a subset of Rust features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nFocus on structs, enums, and basic pattern matching  </li>\n  <li>\nDefer learning advanced traits, lifetimes, and generics  </li>\n  <li>\nUse <code class=\"inline\">#[derive]</code> macros to avoid boilerplate  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>2. Adopt consistent patterns</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"rust\">// Prefer simple error handling patterns\nfn get_user(id: u64) -&gt; Result&lt;User, Error&gt; {\n    let user = db.find_user(id)?; // Early return on error\n    Ok(user)\n}</code></pre>\n<p>\n<strong>3. Minimise complexity with good defaults</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nUse <code class=\"inline\">String</code> over <code class=\"inline\">&amp;str</code> for return values until comfortable with lifetimes  </li>\n  <li>\nStart with <code class=\"inline\">Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> before learning specialised collections  </li>\n  <li>\nPrefer <code class=\"inline\">.clone()</code> initially where ownership is complex  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>4. Focus on idiomatic Rust patterns</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nPrefer composition over inheritance  </li>\n  <li>\nUse enums for representing state  </li>\n  <li>\nLeverage the type system to make invalid states unrepresentable  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>5. Practical tooling setup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nInstall <code class=\"inline\">rust-analyzer</code> for your Editor / IDE of choice  </li>\n  <li>\nUse <code class=\"inline\">clippy</code> to learn idiomatic Rust: <code class=\"inline\">cargo clippy</code>  </li>\n  <li>\nAdopt <code class=\"inline\">cargo fmt</code> for consistent formatting  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThis approach prioritises practical learning over theoretical completeness, allowing you to become productive quickly while gradually adopting Rust’s more powerful features as needed.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nMigrating from Python to Rust can offer considerable long-term benefits, including a cohesite ecosystem, native performance, and streamlined deployment, without requiring complete rewrites. Following a gradual migration path, leveraging hybrid integration, and deliberately limiting the developer’s initial exposure to Rust’s complexity, one can maintain productivity while acquiring experience. This approach can lead to a minimalist software development cycle that will result in increasingly robust software over time.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Answer.ai’s Solveit approach mitigates LLM deterioration by breaking tasks into small steps, editing AI responses, and providing curated context, addressing three key issues: RLHF-trained overenthusiasm, autoregressive decline, and training data flaws.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nA student from fast.ai’s “<a href=\"http://solveit.fast.ai/\">Solve It With Code</a>“ course documented three LLM properties that cause deteriorating AI responses and corresponding mitigation techniques. The course, led by <a href=\"https://nitter.poast.org/jeremyphoward\">Jeremy Howard</a> and <a href=\"https://nitter.poast.org/johnowhitaker\">Johno Whitaker</a>, focuses on transforming problematic AI interactions into learning experiences through systematic problem-solving.</p>\n<p>\nThe approach addresses what the author terms the “deteriorating response pattern” -where AI tools initially appear helpful but produce increasingly broken code through subsequent iterations. The common scenario: Request a weather app from ChatGPT, receive 100 lines of code that doesn’t work, request fixes, encounter additional bugs. This occurs due to fundamental LLM properties, not implementation flaws.</p>\n<h2>\nThe Three Properties &amp; Solutions</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<em>RLHF creates overly eager helpers</em>  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nIssue: Human raters prefer complete responses, so models provide overwhelming amounts of information at once Solution: Work in small steps, ask clarifying questions first Based on Pólya’s problem-solving framework: understand → plan → implement → review</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>\n<em>Autoregression leads to deterioration</em>  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nIssue: Responses degrade over long conversations as models revert to mediocre training patterns Solution: Edit the LLM’s responses to shape better patterns, pre-fill outputs, use examples This involves rewriting AI responses to match preferred style, then using those as context for subsequent interactions</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n  <li>\n<em>Training data is flawed/outdated</em>  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nIssue: Hallucinations and outdated information from lossy compression of training data Solution: “Jeremy RAG”- manually curating relevant context rather than relying on automated retrieval systems Tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/contextkit\">contextkit</a> enable inclusion of specific documentation, followed by verification that the LLM correctly interprets the provided context</p>\n<h2>\nApplication to Modern AI Systems</h2>\n<p>\nThe methodology remains relevant for reasoning models like Claude Code or OpenAI’s Deep Research. The primary challenge isn’t that models cannot answer questions, but rather that users often don’t know which questions to ask initially.</p>\n<p>\nJeremy connected this to Eric Ries’ <a href=\"https://theleanstartup.com/principles\">Lean Startup methodology</a>: working in small steps enables adaptation of thinking and refinement of the actual question being posed (paraphrased from the original).</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nThe Solveit approach transforms problematic AI interactions into learning experiences through iterative, step-by-step problem-solving where each stage builds understanding. By breaking down complex tasks and maintaining control over the conversation flow, users can achieve more reliable results with AI assistants.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Note: Solveit remains unreleased, but these principles apply to existing AI tools.</em></p>\n<p>\nDo you find that decomposing complex problems into smaller components reveals different requirements than initially anticipated?</p>\n",

But is this truly the most effective way to succeed? <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/jason\">Jason Fried</a> and <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/david\">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, founders of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basecamp_(company)&redirect=no\">Basecamp</a> (now <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37signals\">37signals</a>), challenge these conventional notions in their influential book “<a href=\"https://basecamp.com/books/rework\">Rework</a>“. Published in 2010, this manifesto presents an alternative philosophy for building successful businesses in the digital age -one that emphasises simplicity, efficiency, and balance. Drawing from their experience creating profitable web applications with a small team, Fried and Hansson offer practical insights for entrepreneurs and companies of all sizes. Their approach advocates working smarter rather than harder, focusing on what truly matters, and challenging business orthodoxy at every turn.</p>\n<h2>\nFoundational Principles of “Rework”</h2>\n<h3>\nEmbrace Simplicity and Constraints</h3>\n<p>\nFried and Hansson consistently emphasise that constraints aren’t limitations but advantages. With limited resources, you’re forced to focus on what’s essential:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Build half a product, not a half-ar🤬ed product</strong>: It’s better to do fewer  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Embrace constraints</strong>: Limited time, budget, or people can spark creativity  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Underdo your competition</strong>: Instead of adding more features than    <br>\nthings exceptionally well than to attempt everything poorly. Quality trumps   quantity.   and force efficiency. They make you focus on doing more with less.   competitors, focus on solving core problems elegantly. Simplicity is a   competitive advantage.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe authors point to specific examples, such as how Basecamp launched without billing functionality (adding it 30 days later) and how the Flip video camera succeeded by deliberately omitting features that competitors deemed essential.</p>\n<h3>\nChallenge Traditional Business Thinking</h3>\n<p>\n“Rework” consistently questions business conventions that many take for granted:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Planning is guessing</strong>: Detailed long-term business plans are often  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Working long hours is counterproductive</strong>: “Workaholism” leads to burnout  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Growth isn’t always good</strong>: The authors argue against the obsession with  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Skip the “rock stars”</strong>: Instead of obsessing over hiring “ninjas” or “rock    <br>\nexercises in fiction. Instead, make decisions just in time with the most   current information available.   and mediocre output. Productivity isn’t about hours worked but about focused,   quality work.   expansion, suggesting companies find their “right size” and focus on   sustainability rather than constant growth.   stars,” create an environment where ordinary people can do extraordinary work.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nFocus on Action Over Discussion</h3>\n<p>\nA central theme in “Rework” is the importance of creating rather than just talking about creating:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Start making something</strong>: Ideas are worthless without execution. The world  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Launch now</strong>: Perfection is unattainable; get your product out quickly and  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Meetings are toxic</strong>: They interrupt productivity, waste collective time,    <br>\nis filled with people who “had that idea first” but never acted on it.   iterate based on real feedback rather than assumptions.   and often accomplish little. Minimise them ruthlessly.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe authors illustrate this with their own experience building Basecamp, launching quickly with core functionality and improving based on actual customer feedback rather than theoretical market research.</p>\n<h3>\nBuild an Audience-Focused Business</h3>\n<p>\nFried and Hansson outline a customer-centric approach to business development:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Out-teach your competition</strong>: Share knowledge generously through blogs,  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Build an audience</strong>: Develop a following of people interested in what you  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Emulate chefs</strong>: Like celebrity chefs who share their recipes freely,    <br>\narticles, and tutorials. Teaching establishes authority and builds trust with   potential customers.   have to say. When you launch products, you’ll already have an engaged   audience.   sharing your expertise doesn’t diminish your business -it enhances it.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nTheir company blog, Signal vs. Noise, exemplifies this approach, having built an audience of over 100,000 daily readers who became a natural customer base.</p>\n<h3>\nCreate a Sustainable Work Culture</h3>\n<p>\nThe authors advocate for work environments that prioritise sustainability over burnout:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Send people home at 5</strong>: Reasonable working hours increase per-hour  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Avoid policies that treat people like children</strong>: Trust adults to manage  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Avoid unnecessary formality</strong>: Communicate in a human voice rather than    <br>\nproductivity and lead to more creative solutions.   their time and make good decisions.   corporate-speak. Sound like yourself, not like a faceless entity.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nPotential Limitations</h2>\n<p>\nWhile “Rework” offers valuable counter-conventional wisdom, some of its approaches may not suit all business contexts. The authors’ philosophy works particularly well for software and service businesses with low overhead, but manufacturing or capital-intensive industries may require more traditional planning. Additionally, their “do less” approach might not always scale for businesses with complex regulatory requirements or those serving enterprise clients with extensive needs.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\n“Rework” offers a refreshing alternative to conventional business wisdom, advocating for a more thoughtful, balanced, and human approach to work. The book’s central message is that success doesn’t require sixty-hour workweeks, venture capital, or extensive planning -it requires focus on what matters, elimination of what doesn’t, and dedication to quality execution.\\ By challenging assumptions about growth, working hours, planning, and hiring, Fried and Hansson present a blueprint for building businesses that are not only profitable but also sustainable and enjoyable to run. Their philosophy can be distilled to a few key principles: embrace constraints, focus on quality over quantity, prioritise action over planning, and build businesses that respect both customers and employees.\\ Whether you’re running a startup, managing a team, or simply looking to work more effectively, “Rework” provides valuable insights for doing more with less and building something that lasts. It’s not about working more -it’s about working smarter.</p>\n",

    "title": "🌐 Remote: Office Not Required",
    "url": "/posts/remote-office-not-required.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Basecamp founders present a comprehensive guide to remote work, arguing that distributed teams offer increased productivity, access to global talent, and better work-life balance whilst outlining practical strategies for effective communication, maintaining culture, and overcoming common objections to remote collaboration.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<h2>\nWhy Remote Work Makes Sense</h2>\n<h3>\nThe Office Paradox</h3>\n<p>\nOne of the book’s most compelling arguments is that traditional offices often hinder productivity rather than enhance it. Fried and Hansson point out that when people need to get serious work done, they rarely cite the office as their preferred location. Instead, they choose early mornings, late evenings, or weekends- times when interruptions are minimal.\\ Offices have become “interruption factories” where meaningful work is chopped into small, ineffective chunks. Meetings, impromptu desk visits, and constant noise create an environment where deep, focused work becomes nearly impossible. Remote work, by contrast, allows people to create their own distraction-free environments.</p>\n<h3>\nThe End of Commuting</h3>\n<p>\nAnother significant advantage of remote work is eliminating the commute. Beyond the obvious time savings, research shows that long commutes correlate with increased obesity, stress, neck and back pain, and even higher divorce rates. The authors calculate that an average commute consumes 300-400 hours per year- time that could be redirected toward productive work or personal well-being.</p>\n<h3>\nAccess to Global Talent</h3>\n<p>\nPerhaps most importantly, remote work dramatically expands the talent pool. Instead of limiting hiring to a specific geographical area, companies can recruit from anywhere in the world. This not only increases the chances of finding exceptional talent but also naturally leads to a more diverse workforce with varied perspectives.</p>\n<h2>\nMaking Remote Work Work</h2>\n<h3>\nCommunication: The Key to Success</h3>\n<p>\nEffective remote work hinges on communication. The book advocates for a blend of synchronous and asynchronous communication methods:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Overlap Time</strong>: Ensure team members have at least 4 hours of overlap in  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Screen Sharing</strong>: Use tools like WebEx, GoToMeeting, or Join.me to  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Transparent Documentation</strong>: Make information accessible to everyone  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Virtual Water Cooler</strong>: Create spaces for casual conversation to maintain    <br>\ntheir workdays to allow for real-time collaboration when needed.    collaborate visually, making it feel more like sitting side-by-side.    regardless of time zone, eliminating bottlenecks. Basecamp, their project    management tool, was designed specifically with this in mind.    company culture and social connections. The authors used Campfire, their    web-based chat service, for this purpose. While Campfire was discontinued as    a standalone product, it was recently relaunched in 2024 as part of their    ONCE line- allowing users to purchase and self-host the software on their    own servers rather than subscribing to a SaaS model.  </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\nNavigating Legal and Financial Considerations</h3>\n<p>\nThe book doesn’t shy away from the practical challenges of remote work. In the chapter “Taxes, accounting, laws, oh my!” the authors tackle the nuts and bolts of remote employment:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Domestic remote work</strong> is relatively straightforward from a legal  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>International remote work</strong> presents more challenges. The authors outline  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>For remote workers</strong>, they recommend setting up a personal company and    <br>\nstandpoint, with few complications beyond potential state tax implications if   employees work across state lines.   two main approaches: establishing a local office (expensive but comprehensive)   or hiring people as contractors (simpler but with limitations on benefits and   employment protections).   billing as a contractor if working for an international company, though they   acknowledge this isn’t a perfect solution.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe authors are refreshingly honest here, acknowledging that running with a less-than-perfect legal setup is common practice- though they recommend consulting professionals for complex situations.</p>\n<h3>\nOvercoming Common Objections</h3>\n<p>\nFried and Hansson systematically address the objections typically raised against remote work:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>“How do I know people are working?”</strong> If you can’t trust employees to work  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>“What about security?”</strong> With proper protocols, remote work can be just as  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>“We need face-to-face meetings.”</strong> Most meetings can be conducted  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>“We need to maintain our culture.”</strong> Culture stems from values and actions,    <br>\nremotely, the issue is hiring, not location.   secure as office work.   effectively online, and occasional in-person gatherings can satisfy the need   for face time.   not physical proximity.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nAvoiding Remote Work Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>\nThe book doesn’t gloss over remote work’s challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Isolation</strong>: Combat loneliness by encouraging employees to work from  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Overwork</strong>: Without clear boundaries, remote workers may struggle to  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Communication Barriers</strong>: When face-to-face interaction is limited,    <br>\nco-working spaces or cafés occasionally.    disconnect. Managers should focus on results rather than hours worked and    look out for signs of burnout.    misunderstandings can occur. Clear, thoughtful communication becomes even    more crucial.  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>\nBuilding and Managing a Remote Team</h2>\n<h3>\nHiring for Remote Work</h3>\n<p>\nThe authors emphasise that great remote workers possess certain qualities:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Self-motivation</strong>: They can stay productive without direct supervision.  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Strong writing skills</strong>: Since much of remote communication is written,  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Results-oriented mindset</strong>: They focus on output rather than hours at a    <br>\nclear writing is essential.   desk.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nCreating Trust and Accountability</h3>\n<p>\nRather than micromanaging, successful remote teams are built on trust. The book recommends:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Focus on outputs</strong>: Judge work by what’s accomplished, not when or how it’s  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Regular check-ins</strong>: Brief one-on-ones help maintain connection without  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Eliminate roadblocks</strong>: Ensure remote workers have the authority and access    <br>\ndone.   becoming burdensome.   they need to be effective.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nThe Remote Toolbox</h3>\n<p>\nThe authors provide a practical “Remote Toolbox” with specific recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Basecamp</strong>: Their own project management tool for organising tasks,  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Video conferencing tools</strong>: Google Hangouts (now Google Meet) for group  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Screen sharing</strong>: WebEx, GoToMeeting, and Join.me for collaboration and  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>File sharing</strong>: Dropbox for keeping files synchronised across multiple  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Collaborative documents</strong>: Google Docs for real-time collaboration on text  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Co-working directories</strong>: Resources like Regus, LiquidSpace, Desktime, and    <br>\ndiscussions, and files in one central location.   video calls with up to 10 people.   demonstrations.   devices and locations.   documents and spreadsheets.   the Coworking Wiki to find workspaces while travelling or to escape home   office isolation.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nMany of these tools have evolved since the book’s publication, but the core functions they serve remain essential to remote work.</p>\n<h3>\nThe Importance of Meetups</h3>\n<p>\nDespite advocating for remote work, the authors stress the value of occasional in-person gatherings. At their company, they met at least twice yearly for 4-5 days[^1]. These meetups strengthen personal bonds, allow for intensive collaboration, and reinforce company culture.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\n“Remote: Office Not Required” provides a comprehensive blueprint for implementing successful remote work practices. The authors convincingly argue that remote work offers numerous advantages: increased productivity, access to global talent, better work-life balance, and reduced overhead costs.\\ What makes this book particularly valuable is its grounding in real-world experience. Fried and Hansson have built their business on these principles and have navigated the challenges they describe.\\ As we continue to redefine what work means in the 21st century, the insights from “Remote” remain highly relevant. The authors envision a future where work is judged by results rather than location, where talent knows no geographical boundaries, and where both companies and employees enjoy greater freedom and flexibility.\\ For businesses looking to thrive in this new landscape, “Remote” offers not just philosophy but practical strategies for turning the challenges of distributed work into competitive advantages.

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Cloud repatriation is gaining momentum with 86% of CIOs planning to move some workloads back on-premises, driven by unexpected costs, performance needs, security concerns, and desire for greater control- though most organisations are adopting hybrid approaches rather than abandoning cloud entirely, strategically placing workloads where they function most efficiently.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nThe last decade has witnessed the meteoric rise of cloud computing, with organisations large and small migrating their data, applications, and infrastructure to public cloud environments. The promises were compelling: reduced capital expenditure, unlimited scalability, enhanced flexibility, and access to cutting-edge technologies without the overhead of managing physical infrastructure. However, a notable countertrend has emerged in recent years -cloud repatriation. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as “reverse cloud migration,” involves moving workloads, applications, and data back from public cloud environments to on-premises data centres, private clouds, or hybrid setups (<a href=\"https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises\">TRG International, 2023</a>). I’ve previously explored this topic in my article <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-11-14-cloud-repatriation.md %}\">The On-Prem Comeback (aka Cloud Repatriation)</a>, where I introduced the basic concepts and early examples of this trend.\\ This article explores the growing cloud repatriation movement, examining why organisations and individuals are reconsidering their cloud-first strategies, the key drivers behind these decisions, and how they’re implementing these transitions to achieve more balanced and optimised IT infrastructures.</p>\n<h2>\nThe Scale of the Cloud Repatriation Movement</h2>\n<p>\nThe repatriation trend is not isolated but represents a significant shift in how organisations approach their IT infrastructure strategy. According to a 2021 survey by IDC cited by <a href=\"https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises\">TRG International</a>, 80% of organisations reported repatriating workloads or data from public cloud environments. More recent data from the end of 2024 showed that 86% of CIOs planned to move some public cloud workloads back to private cloud or on-premises -the highest on record for the Barclays CIO Survey (<a href=\"https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation\">Puppet, 2025</a>).\\ A recent survey by Rackspace found that nearly seven in 10 companies (69%) have moved at least some applications off the cloud and back to on-premise systems or private clouds (<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/\">ZDNet, 2025</a>).\\ It’s important to note that this doesn’t represent a wholesale abandonment of cloud computing. Only about 8% of organisations are moving their entire workloads off the cloud, according to an October 2024 IDC survey (<a href=\"https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation\">Puppet, 2025</a>). Most are selectively repatriating specific workloads while maintaining others in the cloud, resulting in more nuanced, hybrid approaches to IT infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>\nKey Drivers of Cloud Repatriation</h2>\n<h3>\nCost Optimisation</h3>\n<p>\nWhile the cloud initially promised cost savings through reduced capital expenditure and operational flexibility, many organisations have experienced what industry experts call “bill shock” as their cloud usage scales. According to <a href=\"https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises\">TRG International</a>, “a Gartner study predicts that through 2024, 60% of infrastructure and operations leaders will encounter public cloud cost overruns that negatively impact their on-premises budgets”.\\ This cost concern is particularly relevant for organisations with predictable, high-volume workloads. According to <a href=\"https://www.rsa.com/resources/blog/identity-governance-and-administration/cloud-repatriation-why-enterprise-it-is-returning-from-the-cloud/\">RSA</a>, the company 37Signals announced that its “cloud exit” would save more than $10 million over five years. Similarly, a 2022 report by Andreessen Horowitz found that repatriation of cloud workloads could reduce cloud bills by 50% or more for some companies (<a href=\"https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises\">TRG International, 2023</a>).\\ David Linthicum, a leading consultant and former CTO with Deloitte, attributes much of this cost issue to technical debt: “<em>They didn’t refactor the applications to make them more efficient in running on the public cloud providers. So the public cloud providers, much like if we’re pulling too much electricity off the grid, just hit them with huge bills to support the computational and storage needs of those under-optimized applications</em>“ (<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/\">ZDNet, 2025</a>).</p>\n<h3>\nPerformance and Latency</h3>\n<p>\nPerformance requirements are driving many repatriation decisions, particularly for applications requiring ultra-low latency. According to <a href=\"https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises\">TRG International</a>, “a study by the IEEE found that for certain AI workloads, on-premises GPU clusters outperformed cloud-based solutions by up to 30% in terms of performance per dollar”.\\ This performance concern is especially critical in fields like financial trading, scientific research, and manufacturing where latency can significantly impact outcomes. As <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully\">ComputerWeekly</a> notes, “time-sensitive data includes information that users need to access as rapidly as possible -think financial trading feeds -or where the application is sensitive to latency”.</p>\n<h3>\nSecurity and Compliance</h3>\n<p>\nSecurity concerns and regulatory compliance requirements are powerful motivators for cloud repatriation. According to the Rackspace survey cited by <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/\">ZDNet</a>, data security and compliance concerns were the most common reason for repatriation, cited by 50% of respondents.\\ The implementation of stringent regulations like GDPR has compelled many organisations to keep certain data within specific geographic boundaries. As <a href=\"https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises\">TRG International</a> highlights, “<em>The Data Protection Commission reported a 59% increase in GDPR complaints in 2022, underscoring the importance of data sovereignty</em>“.\\ Despite cloud providers’ significant security investments, many organisations prefer to maintain direct control over their most sensitive data. According to <a href=\"https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises\">TRG International</a>, “<em>a 2023 Thales Cloud Security Study found that 45% of businesses have experienced a cloud-based data breach or failed audit in the past 12 months, highlighting ongoing security concerns</em>“.</p>\n<h3>\nControl and Vendor Lock-in</h3>\n<p>\nThe desire for greater control over hardware and software configurations, along with concerns about vendor lock-in, are also driving repatriation efforts. On-premises infrastructure offers more customisation possibilities that may not be available in public cloud environments.\\ Richard Robbins, founder of TheTechnologyVault.com, observes that “<em>enterprises don’t like being dependent upon someone else’s cloud infrastructure</em>“ (<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/\">ZDNet, 2025</a>). This concern is particularly acute among regulated industries such as financial institutions, which are “<em>moving some or all of their web apps from the cloud back to on-prem or to hybrid setups</em>“ due to “vulnerability and downsides to cloud hosting” that make “executives feel nervous about not having more control”.</p>\n<h2>\nThe Emergence of Balanced Approaches</h2>\n<p>\nRather than a binary choice between cloud and on-premises, organisations are increasingly adopting hybrid and multi-cloud approaches that offer the best of both worlds. This trend allows organisations to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nKeep sensitive or high-performance workloads on-premises  </li>\n  <li>\nLeverage cloud services for scalability and innovation  </li>\n  <li>\nMaintain flexibility to adapt to changing business needs  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAccording to <a href=\"https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises\">TRG International</a>, “<em>The hybrid cloud market is expected to grow from $85.3 billion in 2022 to $262.4 billion by 2027, according to MarketsandMarkets research</em>“. Similarly, “<em>Flexera’s 2023 State of the Cloud Report revealed that 71% of enterprises are pursuing a hybrid cloud strategy, combining public cloud, private cloud, and on-premises infrastructure</em>“.</p>\n<h2>\nPersonal Cloud Repatriation</h2>\n<p>\nThe repatriation trend isn’t limited to enterprises. Individuals are also exploring self-hosting options for personal data.\\ For example, <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@Jeffrey04/114175854454606516\">a fediverse user</a> recently posted about developing a self-hosted photo album application when faced with cloud storage limitations: “<em>Being an enthusiastic photographer, my partner captured moments of us together. However, the increasing stack of photos is accelerating the imminent explosion of my cloud storage</em>“ (<a href=\"https://kitfucoda.medium.com/a-love-story-in-code-building-my-self-hosted-photo-album-b56a4e89ebdd\">KitFu Coda, 2023</a>). This personal project highlights how individuals with technical skills can leverage idle hardware to create cost-effective alternatives to cloud storage services.\\ As <a href=\"https://kitfucoda.medium.com/a-love-story-in-code-building-my-self-hosted-photo-album-b56a4e89ebdd\">they note</a>, “<em>Self-hosting your own data is becoming a trend these days, and it is really not hard to get started</em>“. This trend parallels the enterprise movement, with individuals seeking greater control, cost savings, and privacy for their personal data.</p>\n<h2>\nPlanning for Successful Repatriation</h2>\n<p>\nFor organisations considering cloud repatriation, careful planning is essential. Key considerations include:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Workload Assessment</strong>: Not all workloads benefit equally from repatriation.  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Infrastructure Preparation</strong>: Organisations must ensure they have the  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Skills Assessment</strong>:  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Future-Proofing</strong>:    <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully\">ComputerWeekly</a>    advises that “<em>broadly, repatriation might be the best option where data is    sensitive, time sensitive or expensive to store in the cloud</em>“.    physical capacity, networking, power, and cooling capabilities to support    repatriated workloads. According to    <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully\">ComputerWeekly</a>,    “<em>a large repatriation project might be a prompt to reorganise the    datacentre, perhaps by moving to newer equipment that can pack more storage    into a single rack or that consumes less power</em>“.    <a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully\">ComputerWeekly</a>    notes the importance of having “<em>enough staff to provision and manage a    larger system</em>“ with the necessary “<em>security and privacy skills needed to    handle sensitive data</em>“ and “<em>technical know-how to handle mission-critical,    latency sensitive applications</em>“.    <a href=\"https://www.rsa.com/resources/blog/identity-governance-and-administration/cloud-repatriation-why-enterprise-it-is-returning-from-the-cloud/\">RSA</a>    emphasises the importance of maintaining flexibility: “<em>Organizations should    consider the long-term implications of repatriation for their overall IT    strategy. This includes planning for future scalability, considering how    repatriation fits into the broader digital transformation initiatives, and    ensuring that the new infrastructure aligns with long-term business goals</em>“.  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nCloud repatriation represents a maturing perspective on IT infrastructure strategy rather than a rejection of cloud computing. As organisations gain experience with cloud environments, they’re becoming more strategic about which workloads belong where, based on factors like cost, performance, security, and control.\\ The future likely belongs to balanced, hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both cloud and on-premises infrastructure. As <a href=\"https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation\">Puppet</a> notes, “<em>Cloud repatriation is not an endpoint, but rather a strategic tool in the ongoing evolution of enterprise IT. It empowers organizations to take control of their digital assets, enhance their security posture, and align their technology infrastructure with their business objectives</em>“.\\ For both organisations and individuals, the key is making informed decisions about where and how to deploy IT resources based on specific needs rather than following blanket “cloud-first” or “on-premises-first” policies. This nuanced approach to infrastructure strategy will likely characterise the next phase of digital transformation as the industry moves beyond the initial hype cycles of cloud adoption.</p>\n",

    "title": "📦 From Compilation to Containerisation and Back Again",
    "url": "/posts/compilation-going-back-full-circle.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Programming languages have evolved from compiled executables to interpreted languages and containerisation, but Deno 2.0 brings deployment full circle by enabling TypeScript/JavaScript compilation into standalone binaries-offering simplified cross-platform deployment whilst maintaining ecosystem richness and enabling single-language development across entire application stacks.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nOver the years, I’ve experimented with numerous programming languages and deployment strategies. Python has been my domain’s lingua franca -with its vast ecosystem for data science and AI applications. However, its deployment complexities have consistently been a pain point: managing dependencies, configuring containers, and setting up build pipelines.\\ This search for a better alternative has led me through statically compiled languages like Go and Rust; JIT-compiled languages like Julia; and hosted languages like Clojure and Scala. Yet most failed to provide a good balance between ecosystem richness and deployment simplicity. Recently, however, Deno  <br>\n2.0 has emerged as a compelling solution -particularly with its ability to  <br>\ncompile TypeScript (TS) / JavaScript (JS) to standalone executables.</p>\n<h2>\nThe Circular Evolution of Programming Languages</h2>\n<p>\nProgramming languages have undergone a fascinating evolution. In the beginning (the late 1950s and 1960s), languages like Fortran, COBOL, and C were ahead-of-time compiled -transformed directly into machine code executables that could run without additional dependencies.\\ As computing evolved, the pendulum swung toward higher-level languages -interpreted languages like Python and hosted environments like the JVM- prioritising readability and developer productivity over raw performance. These languages abstracted away machine-level concerns, allowing developers to focus on solving business problems.\\ Yet this shift introduced new challenges. Python applications often require managing complex dependency trees, virtual environments, and platform-specific configurations. The infamous “<em>works on my machine</em>“ problem became so pervasive that containerisation emerged as a solution.\\ While effective, containerisation introduces its own complexities: orchestration, image management, and networking configurations. What began as a solution to simplify deployment has become a complex system requiring specialised knowledge.</p>\n<h2>\nDeno: Compilation Makes a Comeback</h2>\n<p>\nDeno 2.0 represents a return to first principles. As highlighted in the <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZsDqTQs3_G0\">Run JavaScript Anywhere</a> video, its <code class=\"inline\">compile</code> command enables developers to transform JS and TS programs into standalone binaries that run across major platforms -no runtime installation or dependencies required.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"typescript\">// sample.ts\nimport { open } from &quot;https://deno.land/x/open/index.ts&quot;;\n\n// Open a URL in the default browser\nawait open(&quot;https://example.com&quot;);</code></pre>\n<p>\nWith a simple <code class=\"inline\">deno compile sample.ts</code> command, this code becomes a standalone executable that works on any machine without requiring Deno to be installed.\\ This compilation process isn’t traditional transpilation to machine code -it embeds your JS and TS code into a specialized Deno runtime binary (denort). Your script and dependencies are bundled as an EZIP file and injected into the runtime binary, creating a self-contained executable that can be code-signed for distribution.</p>\n<p>\nThe key benefits include:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Cross-platform compatibility</strong> without runtime requirements  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Simplified deployment</strong> with single-binary distribution  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Bundled assets</strong> for complete portability  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Improved startup times</strong> compared to interpreter-based approaches  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nDeno 2.0 enhances these capabilities further with support for npm packages, web workers, cross-compilation, smaller binary sizes, and code signing with custom icons- making it viable for complete applications, not just scripts.</p>\n<h2>\nThe Single Language Advantage</h2>\n<p>\nBeyond deployment simplicity, using a single language across an entire project stack creates significant organisational benefits. I’ve experienced first-hand how using different languages for front-end, back-end, and data science work can create silos within teams.\\ <a href=\"https://dockyard.com/blog/2024/02/06/5-benefts-amplified-saw-switching-to-elixir\">Amplified’s case study</a> demonstrates this point clearly. After switching from a React/JS front-end and Phoenix/Elixir back-end to an all-Elixir approach with LiveView, they reported:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Halved server costs</strong> through more efficient resource utilisation  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Dramatically increased development speed</strong> by eliminating cross-language  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Improved team cohesion</strong> with shared tooling and knowledge  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Enhanced maintainability</strong> through code reuse  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Reduced team size requirements</strong> from 12 developers to just 2    <br>\nsilos  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nTS with Deno provides a similar single language opportunity -allowing teams to build front-end interfaces, back-end services, and data processing workflows with the same toolchain. The JS/TS ecosystem is rapidly maturing for AI, ML, and data science applications, as I noted in my previous article on <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-09-05-deno.md %}\">Modern Data Science and AI Engineering with Deno 2.0</a>.\\ One often overlooked benefit is the reduced cognitive load when developers don’t need to context-switch between different language paradigms, package managers, testing frameworks, and debugging approaches.</p>\n<h2>\nPractical Applications</h2>\n<p>\nDeno’s compilation capabilities shine in several real-world scenarios:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>CLI Tools</strong>: Creating self-contained executables that “just work” across  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Offline Environments</strong>: Deploying to systems without internet access, where  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Cross-Platform Applications</strong>: Building desktop applications that leverage    <br>\nplatforms without complex installation instructions    package resolution at runtime isn’t possible    web technologies without requiring a browser runtime  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nWe’ve come full circle in programming language evolution -from compiled languages like Fortran in the 1950s, to interpreted languages for improved developer experience, to containerisation for managing deployment complexities, and now back to compilation with Deno[^1].\\ Deno’s approach represents a compelling blend- combining deployment simplicity with the ecosystem richness of modern TS/JS. For AI engineering, this addresses many pain points of Python deployment while maintaining access to growing ecosystem of data science tools.\\ While Elixir offers similar single language benefits, its distribution story remains a work in progress with projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/burrito-elixir/burrito\">Burrito</a> showing promise but not yet fully mature. Until then, Deno stands out as a viable alternative for simplified deployment without sacrificing ecosystem benefits.\\ The future of deployment may look surprisingly like its past, just with better languages and tools at our disposal -offering a path toward more cohesive, efficient software development that reduces complexity without sacrificing capability.</p>\n<hr class=\"thin\">\n<p>\n[^1]: Go, Zig, Rust, C/C++ D, Nim, Common Lisp are some prominent examples of</p>\n<pre><code>ahead-of-time compiled languages that -with the exception of Common Lisp-\nexcel in systems programming. However, Deno allows a ubiquitous,\nhigher-level language like JS and its superset TS to join the club of\nlanguages that can easily package code to a cross-platform single binary.</code></pre>\n",

    "url": "/posts/rag-or-cag.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Cache Augmented Generation (CAG) represent two distinct approaches to expanding LLM knowledge: RAG dynamically retrieves relevant documents for each query, offering scalability for large datasets, whilst CAG preloads all information into the model’s context window, providing faster responses for smaller, static knowledge bases.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) face a fundamental knowledge problem: they’re limited to information present in their training data. This creates challenges when dealing with recent events that occurred after training or proprietary information specific to an organization.\\ To address these limitations, two primary augmentation techniques have emerged: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Cache Augmented Generation (CAG). This article breaks down both approaches based on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKWaEZ-_VweaEx1j62do_vQ\">IBM Technology</a>‘s comprehensive explanation from their <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=HdafI0t3sEY\">video on RAG vs CAG</a>, examining how they work, their capabilities, and when to use each one.</p>\n<h2>\nUnderstanding RAG and CAG</h2>\n<h3>\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</h3>\n<p>\nRAG operates through a two-phase system:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Offline Phase (Preparation)</strong>  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Online Phase (Query &amp; Response)</strong>    <ul>\n      <li>\nDocuments are broken into manageable chunks.    - Vector embeddings are created for each chunk using an embedding model.    - These embeddings are stored in a vector database, creating a searchable      knowledge index.    - The user submits a query.    - The RAG retriever converts this query to a vector using the same embedding      model.    - The system performs a similarity search in the vector database.    - It retrieves the most relevant document chunks (typically 3-5 passages).    - These chunks and the user’s query are placed in the LLM’s context window.    - The LLM generates an answer based on both the query and the retrieved      context.      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nFor example, if asked <em>“What film won Best Picture this year?”</em>, the system might retrieve information about <em>“Anora”</em> winning the award, even if this occurred after the model’s original training.</p>\n<p>\nA key advantage of RAG is its modularity - components like the vector database, embedding model, or LLM can be swapped independently without rebuilding the entire system.</p>\n<h3>\nCache Augmented Generation (CAG)</h3>\n<p>\nCAG takes a fundamentally different approach:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nInstead of retrieving knowledge on demand, CAG preloads all available  </li>\n  <li>\nThe entire knowledge corpus is formatted into one massive prompt that fits  </li>\n  <li>\nThe LLM processes this extensive input in a single forward pass  </li>\n  <li>\nThe model’s internal state is captured in what’s called a “KV cache”  </li>\n  <li>\nWhen a user query arrives, it’s added to this pre-existing KV cache  </li>\n  <li>\nThe model can access any relevant information from the cache without    <br>\ninformation into the model’s context window   within the model’s context limits   (key-value cache)   reprocessing the entire knowledge base  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe fundamental distinction: RAG fetches only what it predicts is needed, while CAG loads everything upfront and remembers it for later use.</p>\n<h2>\nComparing Capabilities</h2>\n<h3>\nAccuracy</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>RAG</strong>: Accuracy depends heavily on the retriever component. If the retriever  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>CAG</strong>: Guarantees that all information is available (assuming it exists in    <br>\nfails to fetch relevant documents, the LLM won’t have the facts needed to   answer correctly.   the knowledge base), but places the burden on the LLM to extract the right   information from a large context.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nLatency</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>RAG</strong>: Higher latency due to additional steps of embedding the query,  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>CAG</strong>: Lower latency once knowledge is cached, as answering queries requires    <br>\nsearching the index, and processing retrieved text.   only one forward pass without retrieval lookup time.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nScalability</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>RAG</strong>: Can scale to millions of documents as only a small portion is  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>CAG</strong>: Limited by the model’s context window size (typically ~32k-100k    <br>\nretrieved per query.   tokens), restricting it to a few hundred documents at most.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nData Freshness</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>RAG</strong>: Easy to update incrementally as you add new document embeddings or  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>CAG</strong>: Requires recomputation when data changes, making it less suitable for    <br>\nremove outdated ones.   frequently updated information.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nWhen to Use Each Approach</h2>\n<p>\nThe video presents several scenarios to illustrate when each approach is more appropriate:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>IT Help Desk Bot with Static Manual (200 pages, rarely updated)</strong>  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Legal Research Assistant (Thousands of constantly updated documents)</strong>  </li>\n  <li>\n**Clinical Decision Support System (Patient records, treatment guides, drug    <ul>\n      <li>\n<strong>Best Choice</strong>: CAG    - <strong>Rationale</strong>: Knowledge base is small enough to fit in most LLM context      windows, information is static, and caching enables faster query responses.    - <strong>Best Choice</strong>: RAG    - <strong>Rationale</strong>: Knowledge base is massive and dynamic, precise citations are      required, and incremental updates are essential.    interactions)<strong>    - </strong>Best Choice<strong>: Hybrid Approach    - </strong>Rationale**: Use RAG to retrieve relevant subsets from the massive      knowledge base, then load that retrieved content into a long-context model      using CAG for follow-up questions.      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nThe choice between RAG and CAG ultimately depends on your specific use case. Consider RAG when dealing with large or frequently updated knowledge sources, when citations are necessary, or when resources for running long-context models are limited. CAG is preferable when working with a fixed knowledge set that fits within your model’s context window, when low latency is crucial, or when you want to simplify deployment.\\ As LLM technology evolves with expanding context windows and improved retrieval mechanisms, we may see these approaches converge or new hybrid solutions emerge. For now, understanding the strengths and limitations of both RAG and CAG allows AI engineers to make informed decisions about knowledge augmentation strategies that best suit their specific applications.</p>\n",

At the 2025 AI Engineer Summit, Grace Isford, a partner at Lux Capital, delivered an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS5a8VIKsvA\">insightful keynote</a> on “The State of the AI Frontier” that challenged the prevailing narrative about AI agents. While many industry players proclaim that 2025 marks the “perfect storm” for AI agents, Isford’s presentation offered a more nuanced view, highlighting both the tremendous progress and the significant challenges that remain. This article summarises the key insights from her keynote, examining the current state of AI agents and the strategies developers can employ to overcome persistent limitations.</p>\n<h2>\nThe Perfect Storm for AI Agents</h2>\n<p>\nThe speaker began by acknowledging the remarkable progress in AI over the past two and a half years. The industry has seen exponential advancements since the release of Stable Diffusion in August 2022, with the pace of innovation only accelerating. 2025 has already witnessed several landmark developments:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nThe announcement of the $500 billion Stargate project collaboration between  </li>\n  <li>\nOpenAI’s o3 model exceeding human performance in the Arc AGI challenge  </li>\n  <li>\nDeepSeq’s R1 model launch causing market disruptions and reaching the top of  </li>\n  <li>\nFrance’s new AI initiative announced at the France AI Summit, bringing Europe    <br>\nthe U.S. government, OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle   the App Store   back into the global AI race  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThese developments, alongside other factors, have created what many call the “perfect storm” for AI agents:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nReasoning models (like OpenAI’s o1 and o3, DeepSeq’s R1, and Grok’s latest  </li>\n  <li>\nIncreased test-time compute (more resources allocated to inference rather  </li>\n  <li>\nEngineering and hardware optimisations driving efficiency  </li>\n  <li>\nCheaper inference and hardware costs  </li>\n  <li>\nA narrowing gap between open-source and closed-source models  </li>\n  <li>\nMassive infrastructure investments from governments and corporations    <br>\noffering) now outperform humans in various benchmarks    than just training)    worldwide  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>\nThe Reality Gap: Why AI Agents Aren’t Quite Working Yet</h2>\n<p>\nDespite this promising landscape, Isford argued that truly autonomous AI agents aren’t functioning as seamlessly as industry hype suggests. To illustrate this point, she shared a real-world example of trying to use OpenAI’s operator to book a flight from New York to San Francisco with specific requirements. Despite seemingly straightforward criteria (departure time after 3 PM, avoiding rush hour, specific airlines, budget constraints, seat preferences), the agent failed to deliver a satisfactory result.</p>\n<p>\nThe presenter identified five categories of cumulative errors that prevent AI agents from delivering consistent, reliable results:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n<strong>Decision Errors</strong>: Choosing incorrect facts or overthinking/exaggerating  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Implementation Errors</strong>: Encountering access issues or integration failures  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Heuristic Errors</strong>: Applying wrong criteria or missing critical contextual  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Taste Errors</strong>: Failing to account for personal preferences not explicitly  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Perfection Paradox</strong>: User expectations heightened by AI’s capabilities in    <br>\nscenarios    (like CAPTCHA challenges)    information    stated    some areas lead to frustration when agents perform at merely human speed or    make basic errors  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThese errors compound dramatically in complex multi-agent systems with multi-step tasks. Isford presented a compelling visual example showing how even agents with impressive 99% and 95% accuracy rates drop to 60% and 8% reliability respectively after just 50 consecutive steps.</p>\n<h2>\nFive Strategies for Building Better AI Agents</h2>\n<p>\nThe keynote then shifted to offering concrete strategies for mitigating these challenges and building more effective AI agents:</p>\n<h3>\n1. Data Curation</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nRecognise that data is increasingly diverse (text, images, video, audio,  </li>\n  <li>\nCurate proprietary data, including data generated by the agent itself  </li>\n  <li>\nDesign “data flywheels” that automatically improve agent performance through  </li>\n  <li>\nRecycle and adapt to user preferences in real-time    <br>\nsensor data)   user interactions  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n2. Robust Evaluation Systems</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nMove beyond evaluations for verifiable domains (math, science) to develop  </li>\n  <li>\nCollect signals about human preferences  </li>\n  <li>\nBuild personalised evaluation systems that reflect actual user needs  </li>\n  <li>\nSometimes the best evaluation is direct human testing rather than relying    <br>\nframeworks for subjective assessments   solely on benchmarks  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n3. Scaffolding Systems</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nImplement safeguards to prevent cascading failures when errors occur  </li>\n  <li>\nBuild complex compound systems that can work together harmoniously  </li>\n  <li>\nIncorporate human intervention at critical junctures  </li>\n  <li>\nDevelop self-healing agents that can recognise their own mistakes and correct    <br>\ncourse  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n4. User Experience as a Competitive Moat</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nRecognise that UX differentiation is crucial when most applications are using  </li>\n  <li>\nDeeply understand user workflows to create elegant human-machine collaboration  </li>\n  <li>\nIntegrate seamlessly with existing systems to deliver tangible ROI  </li>\n  <li>\nFocus on industries with proprietary data sources and specialised workflows    <br>\nthe same foundation models   (robotics, manufacturing, life sciences)  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n5. Multimodal Approaches</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nMove beyond basic chatbot interfaces to create more human-like experiences  </li>\n  <li>\nIncorporate multiple sensory capabilities (vision, voice, and potentially  </li>\n  <li>\nBuild personal memory systems that understand users on a deeper level  </li>\n  <li>\nTransform inconsistent but visionary products into experiences that exceed    <br>\ntouch or smell)   expectations through novel interfaces  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nWhile 2025 has created what appears to be a perfect storm for AI agents with advanced reasoning models, increased compute efficiency, and massive infrastructure investments, the reality is that autonomous AI agents still face significant challenges. The cumulative effect of small errors across decision-making, implementation, heuristics, and user preferences creates substantial reliability issues in complex agent systems.</p>\n<p>\nHowever, as this keynote emphasised, these challenges are not insurmountable. By focusing on meticulous data curation, developing sophisticated evaluation frameworks, implementing robust scaffolding systems, prioritising distinctive user experiences, and embracing multimodal approaches, developers can build AI agents that deliver on their transformative potential. The lightning strike of truly autonomous, reliable AI agents may not have happened yet, but with these strategies, the industry is moving steadily toward that breakthrough moment.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Fast.ai founder Jeremy Howard advocates studying historical technology cycles rather than attempting to predict AI’s future, recommending a practical preparation strategy that combines domain expertise with AI capabilities through self-directed learning, side projects, and community engagement- emphasising that success will come from embracing uncertainty whilst pursuing counter-cyclical opportunities.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://jeremy.fast.ai/\">Jeremy Howard</a> isn’t just another voice in the AI conversation. As the creator of <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-ulmfit-and-elmo-the-shift-towards-transfer-learning-in-nlp-b5d8e2e3f664\">ULMFiT</a> (the algorithm that modern LLMs like ChatGPT are based on), founding researcher at <a href=\"https://course.fast.ai/\">fast.ai</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.answer.ai/\">Answer.AI</a>, Howard brings a unique perspective shaped by decades at the forefront of AI development. Recently, when <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/chrisbarber/status/1888037803566747942\">asked about preparing for AI</a>, his response wasn’t about futuristic predictions or doomsday scenarios. Instead, he offered something more valuable: practical wisdom drawn from historical patterns.</p>\n<h2>\nWhy This Matters Now</h2>\n<p>\nWe’re at a critical juncture with AI, similar to where we were with the internet in 1990. Just as the internet transformed every aspect of our lives, AI is poised to do the same. The difference? We can learn from history this time. Howard’s insights are particularly valuable because they come from someone who has not only observed but shaped these technological transitions.</p>\n<h2>\nKey Insights on Technology Evolution</h2>\n<p>\nHoward emphasises a crucial pattern: technology doesn’t just grow linearly. Each innovation follows a “hockey stick” growth curve before flattening into a sigmoid.</p>\n<center>\n      <figure>         <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-mindset/ai-mindset.github.io/0a6eced3bce4c70b7ba715fe7873d1659ce2e9a9/images/hockey-stick-growth.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\" />     <figcaption>Hockey stick growth</figcaption>     </figure></center>\n<p>\nMore importantly, new “hockey sticks” emerge unexpectedly in different areas. This pattern repeats “like clockwork” making historical understanding more valuable than future predictions.</p>\n<h2>\nPractical Preparation Strategy</h2>\n<p>\nRather than trying to predict AI’s future, Howard advocates for:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nEmbracing uncertainty while avoiding both dismissive fear and blind hype  </li>\n  <li>\nTaking a counter-cyclical approach: pursuing opportunities others overlook  </li>\n  <li>\nInvesting months in mastering AI tools, accepting initial poor results as part  </li>\n  <li>\nCombining AI capabilities with deep domain expertise  </li>\n  <li>\nBuilding practical knowledge through side projects and community engagement    <br>\nof the learning process  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nThe Education Perspective</h2>\n<p>\nHoward challenges traditional educational paths, suggesting alternatives:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nSelf-directed learning through resources like  </li>\n  <li>\nMultiple side hustles to build practical experience  </li>\n  <li>\nCommunity building with like-minded innovators  </li>\n  <li>\nUsing AI itself to learn technical skills  </li>\n  <li>\nDeveloping both technical and human skills as a generalist    <br>\n<a href=\"https://course.fast.ai/\">fast.ai</a>  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nThe key takeaway isn’t about predicting AI’s future -it’s about preparing for it intelligently. Howard’s message is: success in the AI era won’t come from perfect predictions or traditional career paths. Instead, it will come from practical engagement, continuous learning, and the ability to combine domain expertise with AI capabilities. As he puts it, those who master this combination will have “superpowers” compared to those who don’t adapt.\\ The most valuable insight? Even AI experts can’t predict AI’s future reliably. The best strategy is to engage deeply with the technology while maintaining a grounded, practical approach to learning and application. The future belongs to the tinkerers, the experimenters, and those willing to learn from both past and present.</p>\n",

    "title": "🚀 A Minimal, Pragmatic Approach to Production-Ready AI & ML with Go",
    "url": "/posts/go-pragmatic-modern-development.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Go offers a refreshingly minimal approach to AI and ML development with its concise 47-page specification, zero-configuration toolchain, and functional equivalents to key Python ML libraries- providing explicit error handling, enforced code consistency, and cross-platform capabilities whilst reducing cognitive overhead and team friction in production environments.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nModern software development often involves navigating complex toolchains, opinionated frameworks, and resource-heavy development environments. Many languages require extensive configuration, multiple runtime dependencies, and introduce significant cognitive overhead through their vast feature sets and multiple approaches to solving the same problem. Node.js, JVM languages, and even Python with its extensive ecosystem can lead to analysis paralysis, code inhomogeneity and team disagreements over tooling and style.\\ Go offers a refreshing alternative. With a language specification under 50 pages, a consolidated toolchain, and a “batteries included” approach, it provides a low-cognitive-overhead solution for developers seeking simplicity and productivity. Its zero-config philosophy, coupled with built-in formatting (<code class=\"inline\">go fmt</code>), linting[^1] (<code class=\"inline\">go vet</code>), and testing tools, promotes code uniformity and reduces team friction over stylistic choices. The sizeable Go community is centralised, using Slack in this case, which serves as a focal point for communication, support, networking, and staying informed about the latest developments.\\ While Go may lack a REPL as sophisticated as IPython or the Julia interactive environment, this limitation encourages proper Test-Driven Development practices rather than the post-implementation testing often seen in REPL-heavy environments. Tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/fatih/vim-go\">vim-go</a>‘s <code class=\"inline\">:GoRun</code> and Go Playground provide sufficient interactive development capabilities for most use cases.\\ Below I’m collecting some thoughts on attractive aspects of Go I’ve discerned so far and how they compare with other languages I’ve considered. The list of Go’s features is far from complete, for example I’ve not mentioned goroutines among others.</p>\n<h2>\nPython vs Go Libraries Comparison</h2>\n<p>\n| Domain              | Python Library                                                                                          | Go Equivalent                                                                        | | ——————- | ——————————————————————————————————- | ———————————————————————————— | | Numerical Computing | <a href=\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy\">NumPy</a>                                                                 | <a href=\"https://github.com/gonum/gonum\">gonum</a>                                              | | Data Processing     | <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\">Pandas</a>                                                          | <a href=\"https://github.com/go-gota/gota\">gota</a>                                              | | Visualisation       | <a href=\"https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py\">Plotly</a>                                                           | <a href=\"https://github.com/MetalBlueberry/go-plotly\">go-plotly</a>                             | | Gradient Boosting   | <a href=\"https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost\">XGBoost</a>                                                              | <a href=\"https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/go-xgboost\">go-xgboost</a>                       | | Machine Learning    | <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn\">Scikit-Learn</a>                                            | <a href=\"https://github.com/sjwhitworth/golearn\">golearn</a>                                    | | Deep Learning       | <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow\">TensorFlow</a>&lt;br&gt;<a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch\">PyTorch</a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/galeone/tfgo\">tfgo</a>&lt;br&gt;<a href=\"https://github.com/sugarme/gotch\">gotch</a> | | LLM Development     | <a href=\"https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain\">LangChain</a>                                                  | <a href=\"https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo\">langchaingo</a>                                    | | Vector Search       | <a href=\"https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client\">Weaviate Client</a>                                   | <a href=\"https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-python-client\">Weaviate Go Client</a>             |</p>\n<p>\n<em>Update: <a href=\"https://github.com/Promacanthus/awesome-golang-ai\">Awesome Golang.ai</a> is a very nice curated list of AI-related Go libraries worth checking.</em></p>\n<h2>\nDevelopment Experience</h2>\n<p>\nGo’s tooling is exceptional. With <a href=\"https://github.com/fatih/vim-go\">vim-go</a> in <a href=\"https://neovim.io/\">Neovim</a>, you get immediate access to formatting, linting, and code navigation. Unlike JVM languages or JavaScript frameworks that may require more complex build configurations, Go projects maintain a simple, predictable structure thanks to <code class=\"inline\">go mod</code>. The <code class=\"inline\">go fmt</code> command -triggered on save by default- enforces consistent code style eliminating debates over formatting and best practices, while <code class=\"inline\">go vet</code> catches common mistakes early.</p>\n<h2>\nError Handling Done Right</h2>\n<p>\nGo’s approach to error handling initially feels verbose:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"go\">result, err := someFunction()\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}</code></pre>\n<p>\nBut this explicitness pays dividends. By treating errors as values that must be handled, Go forces developers to think about failure cases upfront. The <code class=\"inline\">defer</code> keyword complements this by ensuring clean-up code runs regardless of errors:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"go\">file, err := os.Open(&quot;data.txt&quot;)\nif err != nil {\n    return err\n}\ndefer file.Close()</code></pre>\n<h2>\nML/AI Capabilities</h2>\n<p>\nWhile Go isn’t the primary choice for ML/AI experimentation, its simplicity and performance make it excellent for production deployments.

While it won’t replace Python for rapid prototyping and research, its simplicity, performance, and consolidated toolchain make it an very compelling addition to any developer’s toolkit.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nTo me, Go stands out as a pragmatic choice for modern development through its key strengths:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nMinimal cognitive overhead with a 47-page specification  </li>\n  <li>\nZero-config toolchain including formatting, testing, and package management  </li>\n  <li>\nCentralised community, providing a single-source of truth  </li>\n  <li>\nEnforced error handling and clean resource management via <code class=\"inline\">defer</code>  </li>\n  <li>\nGrowing ML/AI ecosystem comparable to Python’s established libraries  </li>\n  <li>\nCross-platform compilation and efficient garbage collection  </li>\n  <li>\nSingle, clear way to solve problems, reducing team friction  </li>\n  <li>\nLightweight development environment compared to JVM, .NET, BEAM or Node.js  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWhile Python remains dominant for ML/AI research, prototyping and -frequently- production, Go excels in production environments where code maintainability, performance, and team collaboration are crucial. Its intentionally limited feature set, combined with a comprehensive standard library and maturing ML ecosystem, makes it a very attractive choice for developers seeking simplicity without sacrificing capability.\\ The language’s design philosophy strongly aligns with my needs as a Data professional looking to reduce tooling complexity and maintain consistent, reliable codebases. Go’s lightweight yet rich toolchain allows writing safe, efficient AI and data-oriented code based on simplicity and reliability. This refreshing alternative in today’s complex development landscape has strongly tempted me to start moving my practice to Go’s more principled approach.</p>\n<hr class=\"thin\">\n<p>\n[^1]: Vet is -in essence- a linter, since it helps improve code quality.

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Chip Huyen’s analysis of AI agents explores how they combine foundation models with specialised tools (knowledge augmentation, capability extension, and write actions), planning mechanisms (ReAct, Reflexion), and evaluation frameworks to accomplish complex tasks whilst highlighting challenges in tool selection, planning efficiency, and error management.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nThis article summarises Chip Huyen’s comprehensive blog post “<a href=\"https://huyenchip.com//2025/01/07/agents.html\">Agents</a>“ adapted from her upcoming book AI Engineering (2025). The original piece provides an in-depth examination of intelligent agents, which represent a fundamental concept in AI, defined by Russell and Norvig in their seminal 1995 book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence:_A_Modern_Approach\">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a> as anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon it through actuators. Huyen explores how the unprecedented capabilities of foundational models have transformed theoretical possibilities into practical applications, enabling agents to operate in diverse environments -from digital workspaces for coding to physical settings for robotics. These agents can now assist with tasks ranging from website creation to complex negotiations.</p>\n<h2>\nUnderstanding Agents and Their Tools</h2>\n<p>\nAn agent’s effectiveness is determined by two key factors: its environment and its tool inventory. The environment defines the scope of possible actions, while tools enable the agent to perceive and act within this environment. Modern agents leverage three distinct categories of tools.\\ Knowledge augmentation tools, including text retrievers and web browsing capabilities, prevent model staleness by enabling access to current information. However, web browsing tools require careful API selection to protect against unreliable or harmful content. Capability extension tools address inherent model limitations -for instance, providing calculators for precise arithmetic or code interpreters for programming tasks. These interpreters demand robust security measures to prevent code injection attacks.\\ Write actions represent the most powerful and potentially risky category, enabling agents to modify databases or send emails. These tools are distinguished from read-only actions by their ability to affect the environment directly. The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09842\">Chameleon</a> system demonstrated the power of tool augmentation, achieving an 11.37% improvement on ScienceQA (a science question answering task) and 17% on TabMWP (a tabular math problem-solving task) through strategic tool combination.</p>\n<center>\n      <figure>            <a href=\"https://huyenchip.com//2025/01/07/agents.html\"><img src=\"https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/agents/8-tool-transition.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\"/></a>         <figcaption>A tool transition tree by Chameleon</figcaption>     </figure></center>\n<h2>\nPlanning and Execution Strategies</h2>\n<p>\nEffective planning requires balancing granularity and flexibility. While <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761\">Toolformer</a> managed with 5 tools and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09842\">Chameleon</a> with 13, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15334\">Gorilla</a> attempted to handle 1,645 APIs, illustrating the complexity of tool selection. Plans can be expressed either in natural language or specific function calls, each approach offering different advantages in maintainability and precision.\\ Foundational Model planners require minimal training but need careful prompting, while Reinforcement Learning planners demand extensive training for robustness. Modern planning systems support multiple control flows: sequential, parallel, conditional, and iterative patterns. The <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629\">ReAct</a> framework successfully combines reasoning with action,</p>\n<center>\n      <figure>         <a href=\"https://huyenchip.com//2025/01/07/agents.html\"><img src=\"https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/agents/5-ReAct.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\"/></a>         <figcaption>ReAct agent</figcaption>     </figure></center>\n<p>\nwhile <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366\">Reflexion</a> separates evaluation and self-reflection for improved performance.</p>\n<center>\n      <figure>         <a href=\"https://huyenchip.com//2025/01/07/agents.html\"><img src=\"https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/agents/6-reflexion.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\"/></a>         <figcaption>Reflexion agent</figcaption>     </figure></center>\n<h2>\nReflection and Error Management</h2>\n<p>\nContinuous reflection and error correction form the backbone of reliable agent systems. The process begins with query validation, continues through plan assessment, and extends to execution monitoring. Chameleon’s tool transition analysis shows how tools are commonly used together, while Voyager’s skill manager builds on this by tracking and reusing successful tool combinations.</p>\n<h2>\nEvaluation Framework</h2>\n<p>\nAgent evaluation requires a comprehensive approach to failure mode analysis. Planning failures might involve invalid tools or incorrect parameters, while tool-specific failures demand targeted analysis. Efficiency metrics must consider not just step count and costs, but also completion time constraints. When comparing AI and human agents, it’s essential to recognise their different operational patterns -what’s efficient for one may be inefficient for the other. Working with domain experts helps identify missing tools and validate performance metrics.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nHuyen’s analysis demonstrates that successful AI agents emerge from the careful orchestration of three key elements: strategic tool selection, sophisticated planning mechanisms, and robust evaluation frameworks. While tools dramatically enhance agent capabilities -as evidenced by Chameleon’s significant performance improvements- their effectiveness depends on thoughtful curation, balancing between Toolformer’s minimal approach and Gorilla’s extensive API integration. The integration of planning frameworks like ReAct and Reflexion shows how combining reasoning with action and incorporating systematic reflection can enhance agent performance. However, as an emerging field without established theoretical frameworks, significant challenges remain in tool selection, planning efficiency, and error management. Future developments will focus on agent framework evaluation and memory systems for handling information beyond context limits, while maintaining the delicate balance between capability and control that Huyen emphasises throughout her analysis.</p>\n",

    "title": "📝 From Vim to VSCode to Neovim",
    "url": "/posts/vscode-to-neovim.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> For me, Neovim strikes the perfect balance between Vim’s simplicity and VSCode’s features. After wrestling with VSCode’s keyboard input failures on Fedora and its resource demands, I found that Neovim’s single configuration file, robust plugins, and cross-platform reliability make it ideal for my Python, Deno, and Clojure development needs. Sometimes stepping back to move forward is exactly what we need!</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nVim’s portable <code class=\"inline\">.vimrc</code> embodies software minimalism at its best. One file, one minute to setup, resulting in a complete development environment. This simplicity served me well until Azure development motivated the use of VSCode.\\ While VSCode worked reasonably well on macOS, Fedora revealed its constraints: keyboard input failures, heavy resource usage, and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35368889/how-can-i-export-settings\">complex environment portability</a> compared to Vim’s <code class=\"inline\">vim +PlugInstall</code>. These limitations drove my search for tools that could maintain simplicity while meeting my development requirements with simplicity and portability in mind.</p>\n<h2>\nVim -&gt; VSCode -&gt; Neovim</h2>\n<p>\nAzure development initially pulled me into VSCode’s ecosystem. While stable on macOS, Fedora revealed deal-breakers: random keyboard input failures that only responded to command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P). No amount of configuration resets or reinstalls resolved these issues.</p>\n<p>\nThis instability, coupled with VSCode’s resource footprint, led me to Neovim. The timing aligned with my exploration of Clojure, where Neovim’s Conjure plugin offered a compelling Lisp development experience that rivaled Emacs.</p>\n<p>\nMy requirements were specific:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nA lightweight Python IDE  </li>\n  <li>\nA lightweight Deno IDE  </li>\n  <li>\nA lightweight Clojure IDE  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThrough <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-11-15-dialogue-engineering.md %}\">Dialogue Engineering</a>, I crafted a complete IDE using a <a href=\"https://github.com/ai-mindset/init.vim\">single configuration file</a>. Neovim’s mixed ecosystem of package managers and dual Vimscript/Lua support presents a learning curve, but the resulting environment is fast, stable, and precisely tailored to my needs. One minor drawback is the complexity of adding colour to Conjure’s output, especially when compared to the rich REPL experiences offered by <a href=\"https://ipython.org/\">IPython</a>, <a href=\"https://deno.com/\">Deno</a>, and Clojure with <a href=\"https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline\">rebel-readline</a>.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nThe journey from Vim to VSCode and finally to Neovim reflects a common pattern in software development: sometimes we need to step backward to move forward. While VSCode offered modern IDE features, its stability and resource issues on Linux highlighted the enduring value of minimal, portable tools.\\ Neovim strikes an elegant balance: it preserves Vim’s philosophy of simplicity and portability while providing modern IDE capabilities. Despite minor challenges with REPL colourisation, its single configuration file approach and robust plugin ecosystem make it a powerful choice for polyglot development. For developers who value both minimal tooling and modern features, Neovim proves that we don’t always have to choose between the two.</p>\n",

This customisation typically requires fine-tuning, a process that has historically demanded significant expertise, computational resources, and sophisticated infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>\nThe Fine-tuning Challenge</h3>\n<p>\nTraditional LLM fine-tuning presents a complex web of interconnected challenges that organisations must navigate. At its core lies the need for sophisticated infrastructure, often requiring specialised hardware and carefully orchestrated software stacks. This infrastructure challenge is compounded by substantial computational costs, making experimentation and iteration expensive.\\ The data challenge is equally significant. Fine-tuning demands large, high-quality datasets that are both rare and expensive to create. Even when such datasets exist, organisations face the risk of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their general capabilities while acquiring new ones. Moreover, validating improvements remains a complex task, requiring careful benchmarking and evaluation frameworks.\\ These challenges have historically restricted fine-tuning to well-resourced organisations, creating a significant barrier to entry for smaller teams and organisations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific needs.</p>\n<h3>\nReal-world Challenges</h3>\n<p>\nThe adaptation of LLMs to specific domains presents organisations with a multifaceted set of practical challenges. In healthcare, medical institutions grapple with the need for models that can accurately process and generate content using complex medical terminology while maintaining strict clinical protocols. This domain expertise challenge extends beyond mere vocabulary; it encompasses understanding of medical procedures, drug interactions, and diagnostic reasoning.\\ The financial sector faces equally demanding requirements, particularly around compliance and regulation. Banks and financial institutions must ensure their models operate within specific regulatory frameworks, making decisions that are not only accurate but also auditable and explainable to regulatory bodies.\\ Data quality emerges as a persistent challenge across sectors. Organisations typically struggle with historical datasets that exhibit inconsistent formatting, missing values, and inherent biases. The challenge extends to maintaining proper version control and data lineage tracking, crucial for both compliance and model improvement cycles.\\ Regulatory constraints add another layer of complexity. Healthcare organisations must ensure strict HIPAA compliance in their model development and deployment processes. Similarly, any organisation handling European data must adhere to GDPR requirements, while specific industries often face additional certification needs. These regulatory requirements must be considered not just in the final deployment but throughout the entire fine-tuning process.</p>\n<h3>\nThe Role of InstructLab</h3>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://instructlab.ai/\">InstructLab</a> emerges as a systematic solution to these challenges, offering a novel approach to LLM fine-tuning that combines:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nSynthetic data generation for high-quality training examples  </li>\n  <li>\nEfficient <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314\">QLoRA</a>-based training pipelines  </li>\n  <li>\nComprehensive evaluation frameworks  </li>\n  <li>\nHardware-adaptive processing  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe rest of this article will elaborate on <a href=\"https://instructlab.ai/\">InstructLab</a>‘s architecture, workflow, and practical considerations, demonstrating how it makes LLM fine-tuning accessible while maintaining rigorous quality standards.

    "url": "/posts/TIL-llm-quantisation.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> GGUF quantisation converts LLM weights from 16-bit to lower precision formats (2-bit to 6-bit) to run large models on consumer hardware. Each format offers different tradeoffs between size, speed, and quality, with Q4_K_S (4-bit) representing the sweet spot for most users—providing 3.7x size reduction while maintaining good quality. Mixed precision strategies (_S/_M/_L variants) further optimize performance by targeting attention and feed-forward layers with higher precision bits.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nWhen experimenting with larger language models (12B, 30B, 70B etc.), choosing the right quantisation format becomes crucial for striking a good balance i.e. running them on consumer hardware while maintaining reasonably good performance. I wrote this guide after spending time looking up different GGUF quantisation types to optimise model selection for my machine’s constraints. This guide explains quantisation methods and their practical tradeoffs to help the reader select the optimal format for their setup.\\ The quantisation formats discussed here are implemented in popular frameworks like <a href=\"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp\">llama.cpp</a>. Q4_K_S is typically the default format due to its good balance of size, speed, and quality, while Q2_K and Q3_K variants are offered for more constrained systems.</p>\n<h2>\nWhat is Quantisation?</h2>\n<p>\nQuantisation converts model weights from 16-bit floating point (F16) to lower precision formats using fixed-size blocks. Each block contains multiple weights that share scaling parameters.\\ Perplexity is the key metric used to measure model quality after quantisation. It indicates how well the model predicts text, the lower the perplexity the better the predictions. For example, a change from 5.91 to 6.78 perplexity represents a noticeable but often acceptable drop in prediction quality. A model with perplexity 6.78 is slightly less certain about its predictions than one with perplexity 5.91.</p>\n<h2>\nBasic Quantisation Types and K-Quantisation</h2>\n<p>\nK-quantisation is a way to make AI models smaller using two methods to store weights (the model’s numbers):</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nType-0 (simpler): reconstructs weight as <code class=\"inline\">weight = scale × quant</code>  </li>\n  <li>\nType-1 (more precise): reconstructs weight as    <br>\n<code class=\"inline\">weight = scale × quant + minimum</code>  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThe “block minimum” <code class=\"inline\">minimum</code> is the smallest value found in a group of weights. By tracking this minimum, we can represent the other values more precisely relative to it, rather than having to represent their full absolute values.</p>\n<p>\nEach format groups weights into “super-blocks” to save space. Specifically:</p>\n<p>\nQ2_K (2-bit):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nUses Type-1 formula  </li>\n  <li>\nOrganises weights in groups of 256 (16 blocks × 16 weights)  </li>\n  <li>\nUses 4 bits to store both scales and minimums  </li>\n  <li>\nTakes exactly 2.5625 bits per weight  </li>\n  <li>\nResult: Shrinks a 13GB model to 2.67GB, but quality drops (perplexity    <br>\nincreases from 5.91 to 6.78)  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nQ3_K (3-bit):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nUses Type-0 formula (simpler one)  </li>\n  <li>\nSame organisation: 16 blocks × 16 weights  </li>\n  <li>\nUses 6 bits to store scales  </li>\n  <li>\nTakes exactly 3.4375 bits per weight  </li>\n  <li>\nBetter quality than Q2_K but bigger file size  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nQ4_K (4-bit):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nUses Type-1 formula  </li>\n  <li>\nDifferent organisation: 8 blocks × 32 weights = 256 total  </li>\n  <li>\nUses 6 bits for both scales and minimums  </li>\n  <li>\nTakes exactly 4.5 bits per weight  </li>\n  <li>\nMuch better quality, file size around 3.56GB  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nQ5_K (5-bit):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nUses Type-1 formula  </li>\n  <li>\nSame organisation as Q4_K  </li>\n  <li>\nAlso uses 6 bits for scales and minimums  </li>\n  <li>\nTakes exactly 5.5 bits per weight  </li>\n  <li>\nQuality getting very close to original  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nQ6_K (6-bit):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nUses Type-0 formula  </li>\n  <li>\nBack to 16 blocks × 16 weights  </li>\n  <li>\nUses 8 bits for scales  </li>\n  <li>\nTakes exactly 6.5625 bits per weight  </li>\n  <li>\nAlmost perfect quality, file size 5.15GB  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe main tradeoff: Fewer bits means smaller files but lower quality. More bits means better quality but larger files. This lets users choose what works best for their needs.\\ When compressing numbers in Type-1 quantisation, each block keeps track of its smallest value (the minimum). When reconstructing the weights, this minimum is added back after multiplication. This helps preserve the range of values more accurately than just using scaling alone.</p>\n<p>\nA simple way to think of this concept is:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nType-0 just stretches/shrinks values using a scale  </li>\n  <li>\nType-1 first shifts all numbers by subtracting the minimum (making them    <br>\nsmaller), then scales them for storage, and when reconstructing adds the   minimum back  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThis is why Type-1 generally gives better quality results but needs more storage space. It has to keep track of both the scale and minimum for each block.</p>\n<h2>\nMixed Precision Strategies</h2>\n<p>\nK-quantisations use different precision levels for different model components. From <a href=\"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp\">llama.cpp</a> documentation, there are three variants:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\nS (Small): Uses single quantisation throughout Example using Q3_K_S:    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\nAll model tensors → Q3_K (3-bit)\\   &gt; Result: 2.75GB size, 6.46 perplexity (7B model)      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\nM (Medium): Strategic mixed precision Example using Q3_K_M:    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\nattention.wv[^1], attention.wo[^2], feed_forward.w2[^3] → Q4_K (4-bit)\\   &gt; All other tensors → Q3_K (3-bit)\\   &gt; Result: 3.06GB size, 6.15 perplexity (7B model)      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\nL (Large): Higher precision mix Example using Q3_K_L:    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\nattention.wv[^1], attention.wo[^2], feed_forward.w2[^3] → Q5_K (5-bit)\\   &gt; All other tensors → Q3_K (3-bit)\\   &gt; Result: 3.35GB size, 6.09 perplexity (7B model)      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThese strategies target attention and feed-forward layers with higher precision because they directly impact text processing quality, as demonstrated by the perplexity improvements in benchmarks: Q3_K_S (6.46) → Q3_K_M (6.15) → Q3_K_L (6.09).\\ The improvement in perplexity scores demonstrates why mixed precision strategies are effective, though they require more storage space.</p>\n<h2>\nPerformance Comparison (7B model)</h2>\n<pre><code>Format | Size(GB) | Reduction | BPW  | Perplexity | RTX4080  | M2Max\nF16    | 13.0     | 1.0x      | 16.0 | 5.91       | 60.0ms   | 116ms\nQ2_K   | 2.67     | 4.9x      | 2.56 | 6.78       | 15.5ms   | 56ms\nQ3_K_S | 2.75     | 4.7x      | 3.44 | 6.46       | 18.6ms   | 81ms\nQ4_K_S | 3.56     | 3.7x      | 4.50 | 6.02       | 15.5ms   | 50ms\nQ6_K   | 5.15     | 2.5x      | 6.56 | 5.91       | 18.3ms   | 75ms</code></pre>\n<p>\n*BPW = Bits Per Weight, Speed in milliseconds per token</p>\n<p>\nPractical Recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nBalanced Performance: Q4_K_S  </li>\n  <li>\nMaximum Compression: Q2_K  </li>\n  <li>\nBest Quality: Q6_K (matches F16)  </li>\n  <li>\nLimited RAM: Q2_K or Q3_K  </li>\n  <li>\nGPU Inference: Q4_K (optimal speed/quality)  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAll data are from recent <a href=\"https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1684\">llama.cpp</a> performance benchmarks and <a href=\"https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml\">GGML</a> implementation details.</p>\n<h2>\nMemory Requirements for Inference</h2>\n<p>\nWhen running quantised models, more RAM is required than the model size alone for inference overhead. Memory requirements depend on several factors:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nModel architecture and size  </li>\n  <li>\nBatch size for inference  </li>\n  <li>\nNumber of layers loaded at once  </li>\n  <li>\nOperating system and framework overhead  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nFor 7B models (verified from benchmarks):</p>\n<pre><code>Format | Model Size | Note\nF16    | 13.0GB    | Base format\nQ4_K_S | 3.56GB    | Common choice\nQ3_K_S | 2.75GB    | Minimum size\nQ6_K   | 5.15GB    | Highest quality</code></pre>\n<p>\nFor larger models scale the memory requirements proportionally and ensure additional overhead memory is available for inference. Test with smaller models first to gauge the system’s capabilities.\\ Actual RAM/VRAM requirements will be higher than the model size. Consider monitoring memory usage during inference to determine exact requirements for a specific setup.\\ Here is an example memory usage scenario for a Q4_K_S 7B model:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nModel size: 3.56GB  </li>\n  <li>\nInference overhead: ~2GB for standard settings  </li>\n  <li>\nOperating system buffer: ~1GB recommended  </li>\n  <li>\nTotal recommended free memory: ~7GB  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThis explains why a model that’s “3.56GB” might need 6-7GB of free RAM/VRAM to run smoothly. The exact overhead varies based on your settings and system.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nModern quantisation techniques offer multiple ways to run large language models on consumer hardware. Here’s what we need to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nK-quantisation provides the best balance through super-blocks and mixed  </li>\n  <li>\nQ4_K_S (4-bit) represents the current sweet spot for most users, offering:  </li>\n  <li>\nFor more constrained setups, Q2_K/Q3_K variants can run larger models with  </li>\n  <li>\nHigher bits (Q5_K, Q6_K) approach F16 quality but require more memory  </li>\n  <li>\nThe _S/_M/_L variants let the user fine-tune the quality-size tradeoff by    <br>\nprecision strategies   - 3.7x size reduction   - Good perplexity (6.02)   - Excellent inference speed on both GPU and CPU   acceptable quality loss   adjusting precision where it matters most  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nBefore downloading a quantised model, check the system’s available RAM and choose a format that leaves enough memory for comfortable operation. For most users with modern GPUs, Q4_K variants will provide the best experience.</p>\n<hr class=\"thin\">\n<p>\n[^1]: In</p>\n<pre><code>[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/examples/convert-llama2c-to-ggml/convert-llama2c-to-ggml.cpp),\n`attention.wv` refers to a tensor that holds the weights for the value\nvectors in the self-attention mechanism of the model.

Many teams struggle with complex metrics and scoring systems that lead to confusion rather than clarity. <a href=\"https://hamel.dev/\">Hamel Husain</a>‘s Critique Shadowing methodology[^1] offers a systematic path from drowning in metrics to developing reliable evaluation systems.</p>\n<h2>\nThe Critique Shadowing Method</h2>\n<p>\nThe key insight behind Critique Shadowing is deceptively simple: start with binary (pass/fail) expert judgements and detailed critiques before building automated evaluation systems. This approach solves two critical challenges: capturing domain expertise and scaling evaluation processes.</p>\n<p>\nThis expert-centric approach echoes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering\">knowledge engineering</a> practices from the 1970-80s, when AI researchers first recognised the necessity of systematically capturing domain expertise.

While the technology has evolved from rule-based systems to large language models, the fundamental challenge of effectively capturing and operationalising expert knowledge remains central.</p>\n<h3>\nImplementation Process</h3>\n<p>\nThe methodology follows a structured, iterative process:</p>\n<center>\n      <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-mindset/ai-mindset.github.io/refs/heads/master/images/Critique%20Framework%20Hamel%20Husain.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\"/></center>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nIdentify a principal domain expert as the arbiter of quality  </li>\n  <li>\nCreate a diverse dataset covering different scenarios and user types  </li>\n  <li>\nExpert conducts binary pass/fail judgements with detailed critiques  </li>\n  <li>\nAddress discovered issues and verify fixes  </li>\n  <li>\nDevelop LLM-based judges using expert critiques as few-shot examples  </li>\n  <li>\nAnalyse error patterns and root causes  </li>\n  <li>\nCreate specialised judges for persistent issues  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThe process is continuous, repeating periodically or when material changes occur. For simpler applications or when manual review is feasible, teams can adapt or streamline these steps while maintaining the core principle of systematic data examination.</p>\n<h2>\nBeyond Automation</h2>\n<p>\nHusain’s most striking observation is that the process of developing evaluation systems often provides more value than the resulting automated judges. The systematic collection of expert feedback reveals product insights, user needs, and failure modes that might otherwise remain hidden. This understanding drives improvements in the core system, not just its evaluation.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nThe Critique Shadowing methodology succeeds by prioritising expert knowledge and systematic data collection over premature automation. For teams building LLM applications, this approach offers a clear path to reliable evaluation systems while simultaneously deepening their understanding of their product and users.\\ LLM evaluation is an active area of interest and research both in academia and industry.

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Don Norman’s timeless design principles- visibility, feedback, constraints, mappings, and error prevention- apply powerfully to AI systems, where abstract interfaces and complex workflows often become overwhelming.

This article presents a minimalist approach to implementing these principles using a carefully selected set of tools that maximise impact while reducing operational overhead. Norman’s insights about visibility, feedback, constraints, and mappings translate powerfully to AI system design, where abstract interfaces and complex workflows can easily become overwhelming. Just as Norman observed that poorly designed physical objects lead to user frustration and errors, poorly architected AI systems can result in maintenance nightmares, hidden failure modes, and costly debugging cycles. By applying his principles- making system states visible, providing clear feedback, implementing appropriate constraints, and creating natural mappings between components, we can build AI systems that are not only more intuitive to use but also easier to maintain, debug, and evolve over time.</p>\n<h2>\nDesign Principles Implementation</h2>\n<h3>\n1.

    "url": "/posts/pandas-polars.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> While Pandas excels at interactive exploration and smaller datasets with its Python-centric ecosystem, Polars leverages Rust’s performance for parallel processing and memory efficiency in large-scale data operations. Choose Pandas for rapid prototyping and datasets under 1GB, and Polars for production environments with demanding performance requirements or cross-language development needs in Python, Node.js, and Rust.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nThe world of Python data processing has long revolved around the well established <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\">Pandas</a> library, but in recent years, a new contender has emerged in the form of <a href=\"https://pola.rs/\">Polars</a>. This post aims to provide a comparison of these two powerful data processing tools, that empowers the reader to make an informed choice on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<h2>\nArchitecture and Design Comparison</h2>\n<p>\nAt the core, Pandas and Polars differ in their underlying implementation and design philosophies.</p>\n<h3>\nImplementation and Performance</h3>\n<p>\nThe Pandas library is written in Python/Cython, with a focus on single-threaded operations. In contrast, Polars is built upon the Rust programming language, leveraging its performance and concurrency capabilities to enable parallel processing by default.\\ This distinction in implementation has significant implications for memory management and query optimisation. Pandas typically works with multiple copies of data, while Polars utilises the Arrow data format, which allows for more efficient memory usage. Additionally, Polars offers automatic query optimisation, whereas Pandas users must rely on a more sequential, manual approach to optimising their data processing pipelines.</p>\n<p>\n| Feature            | Pandas          | Polars              | | —————— | ————— | ——————- | | Implementation     | Python/Cython   | Rust                | | Processing         | Single-threaded | Parallel by default | | Memory Management  | Multiple copies | Arrow format        | | Query Optimisation | Sequential      | Automatic           |</p>\n<h3>\nAPI and Language Support</h3>\n<p>\nThe API and language support differences between Pandas and Polars are quite notable. Pandas -being a Python-only library- offers a mix of method chaining and attribute access approaches. In contrast, Polars takes a more expansive approach, providing implementations in Python, Node.js, and the Rust programming language itself.\\ This language versatility of Polars enables seamless JavaScript and TypeScript integration, allowing data scientists and developers to leverage the same performance benefits regardless of their preferred language. Additionally, Polars maintains a consistent method chaining syntax across these different language environments, simplifying the learning curve for users who may work with the library in multiple contexts.</p>\n<p>\n| Feature              | Pandas                                     | Polars                     | | ——————– | —————————————— | ————————– | | Language Support     | Python-only                                | Python, Node.js, Rust      | | API Style            | Mixed method chaining and attribute access | Consistent method chaining | | Language Integration | N/A                                        | JavaScript/TypeScript      |</p>\n<h2>\nUse Cases and Trade-offs</h2>\n<p>\nWhile both Pandas and Polars excel in the realm of data processing, each library has distinct strengths and weaknesses that make them better suited for different use cases and scenarios.</p>\n<h3>\nWhen to Choose Pandas</h3>\n<p>\nPandas shines when it comes to interactive data exploration and working with smaller datasets, typically under 1GB in size. The library’s deep integration with the broader scientific computing ecosystem in Python, along with its intuitive syntax and extensive documentation, make it an excellent choice for rapid prototyping, educational contexts, and projects that require seamless compatibility with the Python-centric data science toolchain.</p>\n<h3>\nWhen to Choose Polars</h3>\n<p>\nOn the other hand, Polars emerges as the preferred choice for large-scale data processing, particularly for datasets exceeding 1GB. The library’s Rust-based implementation and parallel processing capabilities make it a more suitable option for production environments with demanding performance requirements. Polars also excels in memory-constrained systems, thanks to its efficient use of the Arrow data format, and it is an attractive choice for cross-language development teams due to its implementations in Python, Node.js, and Rust.\\ Furthermore, Polars demonstrates strengths in handling complex data transformations and time series processing at scale, areas where its optimised query engine and parallel processing features can truly shine.</p>\n<p>\nTo summarise the key differences:</p>\n<p>\n| Consideration         | Pandas                                        | Polars                                          | | ——————— | ——————————————— | ———————————————– | | Dataset Size          | Small to medium (&lt;1GB)                        | Scales to larger datasets                       | | Performance           | Suitable for interactive exploration          | Excels at large-scale processing                | | Memory Efficiency     | Works with multiple data copies               | Utilises Arrow format for efficiency            | | Query Optimisation    | Sequential, manual approach                   | Automatic optimisation                          | | Language Support      | Python-only                                   | Python, Node.js, Rust                           | | Ecosystem Integration | Strong in Python scientific computing         | Limited cross-language integration              | | Learning Resources    | Extensive documentation and community support | Younger ecosystem, less comprehensive resources |</p>\n<p>\nUltimately, the choice between Pandas and Polars should be guided by the specific requirements of your project, such as data volume, performance needs, language preferences, and ecosystem integration requirements. Both libraries offer powerful data processing capabilities, and selecting the right one can significantly impact the success and efficiency of your data-driven initiatives.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nAfter carefully evaluating the key differences between Pandas and Polars, the choice between the two data processing libraries ultimately comes down to the specific requirements of your project and use case.\\ For projects focused on interactive data exploration and working with smaller datasets (under 1GB), Pandas remains the go-to choice. Its deep integration with the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem, extensive documentation, and large community make it a reliable and familiar option for many data scientists and developers.\\ However, for large-scale data processing, production environments, and cross-language teams, Polars presents a compelling alternative. Its performance advantages, memory efficiency, and multi-language support (Python, Node.js, Rust) make it an increasingly attractive choice for modern data-intensive applications.\\ When deciding between Pandas and Polars, consider factors such as dataset size, performance requirements, memory constraints, language preferences, and the level of ecosystem integration needed. Pandas may be the better fit for projects focused on rapid prototyping and educational use, while Polars can shine in mission-critical, large-scale data processing tasks.\\ Ultimately, both Pandas and Polars are powerful data processing tools, and the choice between them should be guided by the specific needs and constraints of your project. As the data processing landscape continues to evolve, it’s valuable to stay informed about the trade-offs and emerging alternatives to ensure you make the most informed decision for your team and organisation.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> This comprehensive guide explores ten distinct modelling approaches across statistics, machine learning, and causal inference-advocating for “T-shaped” expertise where practitioners develop deep knowledge in one or two mindsets aligned with their domain needs whilst maintaining sufficient breadth to recognise when different approaches are required, with specific recommendations for research, business, and product development contexts.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nAs a practitioner looking to work effectively with real-world data and generate meaningful insights, I face a crucial decision: which modelling approaches should I invest my time and energy in learning? After discovering Christoph Molnar’s <a href=\"https://christophmolnar.com/books/modeling-mindsets/\">Modeling Mindsets</a>, I realised this isn’t about picking the “best” approach. It’s about becoming what he calls a “T-shaped modeller”.\\ The concept is elegantly simple: rather than trying to master every possible approach (impossible) or limiting myself to just one (ineffective), I should aim to develop:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nDeep expertise in one or two mindsets that align with my goals and problems  </li>\n  <li>\nWorking knowledge of other approaches to recognise when my primary tools    <br>\naren’t optimal  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThis systematic exploration serves two purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nTo understand the landscape: What are the main modelling mindsets available  </li>\n  <li>\nTo make an informed choice: Which mindset(s) should I focus on mastering,    <br>\ntoday? What are their core premises, strengths, and limitations?    given my goals and constraints?  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nEach mindset represents a different way of approaching problems through data. From the probability-focused world of statistical modelling to the interactive realm of reinforcement learning, from the causality-oriented approach to the pattern-finding nature of unsupervised learning, each offers unique tools and perspectives.\\ By examining these mindsets systematically, I aim to make an informed decision about where to focus my learning efforts while maintaining enough breadth to recognise when I should switch approaches. This isn’t just about theoretical understanding, it’s about practical effectiveness in solving real-world problems.</p>\n<p>\nLet’s explore each mindset in turn, focusing on their fundamental premises, key strengths, and limitations to guide this decision.</p>\n<h2>\nStatistical Modelling: The Foundation of Data-Driven Inference</h2>\n<p>\n<em>This mindset sees the world through probability distributions. At its core, it’s about modelling how data is generated and making inferences under uncertainty.</em></p>\n<p>\nKey Aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nEverything has a distribution, from dice rolls to customer behaviours  </li>\n  <li>\nModels encode assumptions about how data is generated  </li>\n  <li>\nModels are evaluated by both checking if their assumptions make sense and  </li>\n  <li>\nUses same data for fitting and evaluation, unlike machine learning approaches    <br>\nmeasuring how well they match the data  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nPrimary Strengths:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nProvides rigorous mathematical framework for handling uncertainty  </li>\n  <li>\nStrong theoretical foundation spanning decades of research  </li>\n  <li>\nForces explicit consideration of data-generating processes  </li>\n  <li>\nVersatile for decisions, predictions, and understanding  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nNotable Limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nManual and often tedious modelling process  </li>\n  <li>\nStruggles with complex data types like images and text  </li>\n  <li>\nGood model fit doesn’t guarantee good predictions  </li>\n  <li>\nLess automatable than modern machine learning approaches  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThis mindset serves as the foundation for three important sub-approaches: Frequentism, Bayesianism, and Likelihoodism, each with its own interpretation of probability and evidence. For someone starting in data science, understanding statistical modelling provides crucial groundwork for understanding both traditional statistics and modern machine learning approaches.</p>\n<h2>\nFrequentism: Making Decisions Through Repeated Experiments</h2>\n<p>\n<em>Frequentism views probability as long-run frequency and assumes that parameters in the world are fixed but unknown. It’s the dominant approach in many scientific fields, particularly in medicine and psychology.</em></p>\n<p>\nKey Aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nInterprets probability as frequency in infinite repetitions  </li>\n  <li>\nMakes decisions through hypothesis tests and confidence intervals  </li>\n  <li>\nRelies on “imagined experiments” to draw conclusions  </li>\n  <li>\nFocuses on estimating fixed, true parameters  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nPrimary Strengths:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nEnables clear, binary decisions  </li>\n  <li>\nComputationally fast compared to other approaches  </li>\n  <li>\nNo need for prior information  </li>\n  <li>\nWidely accepted in scientific research  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nNotable Limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nOften oversimplifies complex questions into yes/no decisions  </li>\n  <li>\nVulnerable to p-hacking (searching for significant results)  </li>\n  <li>\nInterpretation can be counterintuitive, especially for confidence intervals  </li>\n  <li>\nResults depend on the experimental design, not just the data  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nFor practitioners, Frequentism offers a well-established framework with clear decision rules and strong scientific acceptance. However, its limitations in handling uncertainty and tendency toward oversimplification have led to growing interest in alternative approaches like Bayesian inference.</p>\n<h2>\nBayesianism: Learning Through Updated Beliefs</h2>\n<p>\n<em>Bayesianism stands out by treating parameters themselves as random variables with distributions, fundamentally different from Frequentism’s fixed-parameter view.

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> This historical overview traces AI’s evolution through four major paradigms: from symbolic reasoning and expert systems (1950s-1970s), through neural networks and Bayesian approaches (1980s-1990s), to the Big Data revolution (2000s-2010s), culminating in today’s integrated systems that combine multiple philosophical approaches-suggesting future progress requires unifying these diverse methodologies rather than choosing between them.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h1>\nAI’s Historical Evolution</h1>\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nThe field of Artificial Intelligence has undergone several paradigm shifts since its inception, each representing a distinct approach to creating intelligent systems. Drawing from Pedro Domingos’ framework in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm\">The Master Algorithm</a> we can trace how different schools of thought have shaped our understanding and implementation of AI technologies.</p>\n<h2>\nHistorical Evolution</h2>\n<h3>\nEarly Foundations: Symbolic AI and Expert Systems (1950s-1970s)</h3>\n<p>\nThe pioneers of AI began with symbolic reasoning, believing intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. This <em>symbolist</em> approach offered explicit reasoning chains and interpretability but struggled with real-world complexity. Expert Systems followed, successfully applying rule-based reasoning to narrow domains while revealing the challenges of scaling knowledge-based systems.</p>\n<h3>\nThe Rise of Neural Approaches (1980s-1990s)</h3>\n<p>\nThe <em>connectionist</em> movement emerged with neural networks, drawing inspiration from biological systems. This era introduced pattern recognition capabilities and learning from examples. Simultaneously, the <em>Bayesian</em> school brought statistical methods to the forefront, offering principled approaches to handling uncertainty but requiring significant data and computational resources.</p>\n<h3>\nThe Data Revolution (2000s-2010s)</h3>\n<p>\nBig Data and Deep Learning foundations emerged as the <em>analogiser</em> school gained prominence. This period saw the convergence of massive datasets, computational power, and sophisticated architectures. Deep Learning breakthrough demonstrated the power of automatic feature learning, though at the cost of increased computational demands and reduced interpretability.</p>\n<h3>\nContemporary AI: The Era of Integration (2020s)</h3>\n<p>\nCurrent AI systems, particularly large language models, represent a synthesis of multiple schools. They combine symbolic reasoning[^1], neural architectures[^2], and statistical learning[^3], achieving impressive generative capabilities and few-shot learning. However, they face challenges in resource requirements, reliability, and alignment with human values. A nicely distilled overview of what is today’s AI, comes from an <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/karpathy/status/1864033537479135369\">Andrej Karpathy Tweet</a>.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nThe evolution of AI reveals a field shaped by competing philosophies, each contributing essential insights. As Domingos argues, the future likely lies not in the dominance of any single approach but in their unification. While recent advances demonstrate the potential of synthesising different methods, significant challenges remain in creating truly intelligent systems that are both powerful and reliable.</p>\n<p>\nThe path forward requires building on these foundations while addressing core challenges in efficiency, interpretability, and alignment. Rather than choosing between different schools of thought, the field must continue to integrate their strengths while mitigating their individual weaknesses.</p>\n<hr class=\"thin\">\n<p>\n[^1]: Symbolic reasoning in modern AI manifests through attention mechanisms and</p>\n<pre><code>transformers&#39; ability to process structured input like code or mathematical\nexpressions.

    "url": "/posts/iterative-refinement.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Drawing inspiration from Norvig, Howard, and Sanderson, this article advocates for iterative refinement over traditional unit testing, emphasising techniques like doctests that keep verification close to code-reducing maintenance burden whilst improving reliability by focusing on actual usage patterns rather than rigid test-driven development that can lead to outdated tests and ossified code structures.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nIn the realm of software development and related fields, three influential figures -Peter Norvig (former Director of Research at Google), Jeremy Howard (founder of fast.ai), and Grant Sanderson (creator of 3Blue1Brown)- demonstrate the power of iterative refinement over rigid test-driven development. Their approaches, while applied in different domains, share common principles that challenge traditional development practices.</p>\n<h2>\nIterative Refinement</h2>\n<h3>\nPeter Norvig’s Software Development</h3>\n<p>\nNorvig’s approach, demonstrated in both his <a href=\"https://norvig.com/docex.html\">original <code class=\"inline\">docex</code> module</a> and his <a href=\"https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html\">spell corrector implementation</a>, emphasises tests that are tightly coupled with the code they verify. Before Python’s doctests[^1] were officially supported, he created the <code class=\"inline\">docex</code> module specifically to write tests in docstrings using a concise syntax like</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python\">def factorial(n):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return the factorial of n, an exact integer &gt;= 0.\n       &gt;&gt;&gt; [factorial(n) for n in range(6)]\n       [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]\n       It must also not be ridiculously large:\n       &gt;&gt;&gt; factorial(1e100)\n       Traceback (most recent call last):\n       ...\n       OverflowError: n too large\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n    ...\n\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\n    import doctest\n    doctest.testmod()</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"console\">$ python fact.py -v\nTrying:\n    [factorial(n) for n in range(6)]\nExpecting:\n    [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]\nok\nTrying:\n    factorial(1e100)\nExpecting:\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n        ...\n    OverflowError: n too large\nok\n2 items passed all tests:\n   1 test in __main__\n   6 tests in __main__.factorial\n7 tests in 2 items.\n7 passed.\nTest passed.\n$</code></pre>\n<p>\nEven in his spell corrector, Norvig uses simple functions with in-line test cases rather than separate test files. This approach keeps tests close to the code they verify, making them part of the living documentation rather than separate artefacts that can drift out of sync.\\ <em>Update: While randomly skimming through PyTorch code, it was good to stumble across examples of <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/autograd/grad_mode.py\">code containing doctests</a>.</em></p>\n<h3>\nJeremy Howard’s Machine Learning Development</h3>\n<p>\nHoward’s methodology, evidenced in fast.ai’s development and his book “Deep Learning for Coders” advocates for rapid prototyping in notebooks. His emphasis lies in getting end-to-end solutions working quickly, then iteratively improving them based on actual usage patterns. In his latest course <a href=\"https://solveit.fast.ai/\">SolveIt</a>, Howard extends this iterative philosophy to <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-11-15-dialogue-engineering.md %}\">Dialogue Engineering</a>, i.e. using Large Language Models in an iterative conversation to develop solutions, demonstrating how modern AI can be integrated into the development workflow while maintaining the principles of continuous refinement.</p>\n<h3>\nGrant Sanderson’s Visual Mathematics</h3>\n<p>\nThis iterative philosophy extends to mathematical animations. In Grant Sanderson’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbu7Zu5X1zI\">How I animate</a> video, he demonstrates how he builds visualisations incrementally, starting with basic shapes and gradually refining them while continuously previewing the results. This approach allows for creative exploration while maintaining momentum.</p>\n<h3>\nThe Problem with Traditional Testing</h3>\n<p>\nTraditional unit testing often fragments development workflow by requiring separate test maintenance and can lead to ossified code structures. When tests aren’t exercised regularly, they become outdated, creating false confidence. This is particularly problematic in rapidly evolving domains like AI, where interfaces and requirements frequently change.</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nInstead of extensive unit test suites, it’s worth considering:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nWriting working code first  </li>\n  <li>\nUsing doctests for critical functions  </li>\n  <li>\nRelying on end-to-end validation  </li>\n  <li>\nRefactoring based on actual usage patterns  </li>\n  <li>\nKeeping tests focused on stable interfaces  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThis approach reduces maintenance burden while ensuring code remains reliable where it matters most, that is in production.</p>\n<p>\n“<em>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute</em>“- Abelson &amp; Sussman.

Yet, its fragmented tooling landscape often leads to decision paralysis and opinions galore: virtualenv or venv? pip or conda? black or flake8? These choices, while providing flexibility, can create unnecessary cognitive load and often foster dogmatic opinions about “the right way” to do things. After exploring alternative stacks, I’m returning to Python. Not least because it’s perfect, but because it’s productive. The challenge isn’t Python’s capabilities; it’s the abundance and complexity of its tooling. This article presents a carefully curated, minimal toolkit that leverages Python’s ecosystem while avoiding its common setup pitfalls.</p>\n<h2>\nMotivation</h2>\n<p>\nThe appeal of integrated toolchains like Deno 2.0 is undeniable. Zero setup, immediate productivity, and a cohesive development experience. My recent exploration of alternative stacks revealed the value of unified tools that just work. While JavaScript’s ecosystem for Data Science and AI is growing rapidly, it still lacks the depth and maturity of Python’s scientific computing stack.\\ This exploration led to an important realisation: aside from an expansive Data and AI ecosystem, Python development can be achieved with a streamlined workflow that increases productivity and decreases complexity. Rather than accepting the cognitive overhead of multiple competing tools, I decided to create my own compact toolchain that meets most Data Science and AI requirements with minimalism, simplicity, and clarity in mind. The goal isn’t to prescribe another “right way” of doing things, but rather to demonstrate how a carefully chosen set of modern tools can create a development experience that rivals the integrated approaches of newer platforms while leveraging Python’s mature ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>\nMy Approach</h2>\n<h3>\nLocal Development</h3>\n<p>\nMy toolchain starts with the following foundational choices that eliminate common Python setup headaches:</p>\n<ol start=\"0\">\n  <li>\n    <p>\n<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/\">PEP8</a>: Let’s start with a style guide, so    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n<a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/\">uv</a>: A blazing-fast Python package and project      <br>\nthat the team is on the same page    manager, written in Rust.

By carefully choosing modern tools that prioritise speed, simplicity, and clarity, we can create a development environment that’s both powerful and pleasant to use.</p>\n<p>\nThe beauty of this approach lies not in its prescriptiveness, but in its principles: <em>minimize tooling</em>, <em>maximise capability</em>, and <em>maintain clarity</em>. Whether you adopt this exact stack or use it as inspiration for your own, the goal remains the same: bring the focus back to solving problems rather than managing tools.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> While TF-IDF ranks documents based on term frequency weighted by rarity across a corpus, BM25 improves upon this foundation by adding term frequency saturation and document length normalisation. Choose TF-IDF for simpler tasks with uniformly-sized documents, but prefer BM25 for search engines handling varied document lengths where its sophisticated algorithm delivers superior retrieval performance despite requiring more complex implementation and parameter tuning.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nWhen building search engines or document retrieval systems, two algorithms often come up: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf\">TF-IDF</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25\">Okapi BM25</a>. While both aim to rank documents by relevance, they differ significantly in their approach and effectiveness. Today, I learned the key differences between these techniques and when to use each one.</p>\n<h2>\nTF-IDF: The Classic Approach</h2>\n<p>\nTF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) ranks documents based on how frequently terms appear in a document, weighted by how rare those terms are across all documents. It’s straightforward: if a word appears often in a document but is rare across the corpus, it’s probably important[^1]. $idf$ is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p>\n$$idf(t) = \\log\\frac{N}{n_t}$$</p>\n<p>\nwhere:\\ $N$ : Total number of documents in corpus\\ $n_t$ : Number of documents containing term $t$</p>\n<p>\nTF-IDF is derived by the following calculation:</p>\n<p>\n$$TF\\text{-}IDF(t,d) = tf(t,d) \\cdot idf(t)$$</p>\n<p>\nwhere:\\ $tf(t,d)$ : Frequency of term $t$ in document $d$</p>\n<h3>\nAdvantages</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nSimple to understand and implement  </li>\n  <li>\nComputationally efficient  </li>\n  <li>\nWorks well for documents of similar length  </li>\n  <li>\nGreat for basic document classification  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nDisadvantages</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nNo term frequency saturation (more occurrences always mean higher scores)  </li>\n  <li>\nDoesn’t handle varying document lengths well  </li>\n  <li>\nCan overemphasise common terms in long documents  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nBM25: The Modern Evolution</h2>\n<p>\nBM25 (Best Match 25) builds upon TF-IDF’s foundation but adds two crucial improvements: term frequency saturation and document length normalisation. Note how the $idf_{BM25}$ component differs from TF-IDF’s:</p>\n<p>\n$$idf_{BM25}(t) = \\log\\frac{N- n_t + 0.5}{n_t + 0.5}$$</p>\n<p>\nThis modification provides smoother IDF weights and better handles edge cases.</p>\n<p>\n$$BM25(t,d) = \\frac{tf(t,d) \\cdot (k<em>1 + 1)}{tf(t,d) + k_1 \\cdot (1- b + b \\cdot \\frac{|d|}{avgdl})} \\cdot idf</em>{BM25}$$</p>\n<p>\nwhere:\\ $tf(t,d)$ : Frequency of term $t$ in document $d$\\ $\\|d\\|$ : Length of document $d$ (in words)\\ $avgdl$ : Average document length in corpus\\ $k_1$ : Term frequency saturation parameter (typically 1.2-2.0)\\ $b$ : Length normalisation parameter (typically 0.75)\\ $N$ : Total number of documents in corpus\\ $n_t$ : Number of documents containing term $t$</p>\n<h3>\nAdvantages</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nBetter handles varying document lengths  </li>\n  <li>\nPrevents term frequency from dominating scores  </li>\n  <li>\nMore nuanced relevance rankings  </li>\n  <li>\nIndustry standard for search engines  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nDisadvantages</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nMore complex implementation  </li>\n  <li>\nRequires parameter tuning  </li>\n  <li>\nSlightly higher computational cost  </li>\n  <li>\nLess interpretable than TF-IDF  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nWhich to Choose?</h2>\n<h3>\nChoose TF-IDF when:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nBuilding basic document classification systems  </li>\n  <li>\nWorking with uniformly-sized documents  </li>\n  <li>\nNeeding interpretable results  </li>\n  <li>\nPrioritising implementation simplicity  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\nChoose BM25 when:</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>\nBuilding a search engine  </li>\n  <li>\nHandling documents of varying lengths  </li>\n  <li>\nRequiring state-of-the-art retrieval performance  </li>\n  <li>\nWorking with user queries  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nWhile TF-IDF remains valuable for simpler tasks and educational purposes, BM25 is generally superior for serious search applications. The choice between them often comes down to the trade-off between simplicity and sophistication. For modern search engines, BM25 is the clear winner, but TF-IDF’s simplicity makes it perfect for learning and basic applications.</p>\n<p>\nRemember: the best algorithm is the one that meets your specific needs. Don’t automatically reach for BM25 just because it’s more advanced – sometimes, simpler is better.</p>\n<p>\n[^1]: This is why TF-IDF is effective at identifying characteristic terms in     documents. It automatically downweights common words like “the”, “and”, “is”     while highlighting distinctive terms that appear frequently in specific     documents.</p>\n",

    "title": "✅ On-boarding that works",
    "url": "/posts/good-onboarding.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Effective onboarding programmes dramatically reduce the productivity gap for new hires by applying evidence-based learning principles: breaking skills into manageable components, providing structured learning paths, targeting 80% proficiency before moving on, defining minimum productive competency, using checklists with frequent feedback, and focusing on mechanical competency- all based on how human memory and learning actually work, transforming the costly standard approach where developers take months to become fully productive.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nI recently watched a lively presentation titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og7NzaVpceE\">opinionated onboarding</a>, that discussed the dramatic impact of onboarding practices on new staff and business success. The speaker, drawing from his experience, articulated that poor onboarding is actively harming companies while good onboarding can transform team productivity and retention. Having experienced both ends of the spectrum myself, I strongly agree with the presenter’s central thesis. Companies can’t afford to waste months getting new staff up to speed, yet that’s what’s happening very frequently. The costs are staggering, both in lost productivity and squandered talent.</p>\n<h2>\nThe Problem</h2>\n<p>\nNew employees face an overwhelming cognitive burden as they simultaneously navigate multiple learning curves: mastering the tech stack, deciphering an unfamiliar codebase, adapting to team workflows, understanding the business domain, and learning organisational structures. Many companies worsen this situation through ineffective approaches, either expecting staff to self-direct their learning with vague instructions like “go learn X and tell us when you’re done”, or by immediately assigning them tickets without proper context or support. This inefficiency comes at a significant cost though. According to the presenter, the average software developer staying at a company for only 20 months, taking 6 months to become productive means losing nearly a third of their effective tenure[^1]. Rather than fixing their onboarding processes, many companies respond by exclusively hiring senior professionals who can “hit the ground running”- an approach that not only limits their talent pool but proves unrealistic even for experienced hires.</p>\n<h2>\nEffective On-boarding Strategies</h2>\n<p>\nAccording to the presenter, research and experience show that effective onboarding follows clear cognitive science principles. Rather than overwhelming new hires with broad, unfocused (occasionally learning) objectives, successful onboarding programs recognise how human learning actually works and structure their approach accordingly. Two key principles emerge as foundational to any effective onboarding strategy:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>\nFocus on building specific capabilities rather than general “understanding”  </li>\n  <li>\nAccount for cognitive limitations:    <ul>\n      <li>\nPeople can only hold ~4 concepts in working memory    - New concepts take more mental space than familiar ones    - Skills must be practiced close to when they’re learned      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h3>\nBest Practices</h3>\n<p>\nThese principles translate into concrete best practices that any organisation can implement. While the specific skills and technologies may vary between teams, successful onboarding programs share common structural elements that maximize learning efficiency while minimizing cognitive overload:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n<strong>Break down complex skills into smaller, manageable components</strong>. For  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Provide structured learning paths rather than self-directed exploration</strong>.  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Aim for 80% proficiency before moving to next skill</strong>. This threshold  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Define minimum productive competency for the role</strong>. Not every skill needs  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Use checklists and frequent practice with feedback</strong>. Clear checkpoints  </li>\n  <li>\n<strong>Focus on mechanical competency to reduce cognitive load</strong>. When basic    <br>\nexample, rather than asking someone to “learn LiveView”[^2] break it down into   specific tasks like creating forms, handling events, or managing state   When new hires must decide what to learn next, they waste valuable mental   capacity on planning rather than learning. A clear, predefined path eliminates   this overhead   ensures sufficient mastery while avoiding diminishing returns from pursuing   perfection   to be mastered immediately- identify what’s truly needed for day-one   productivity and focus there first   provide motivation and progress tracking, while regular feedback prevents   learners from developing incorrect habits   operations become automatic, developers can focus their mental energy on   solving more complex problems  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nEffective onboarding is not just a nice-to-have, it’s a competitive necessity in today’s software industry. While poor onboarding practices continue to cost companies valuable time and talent, the path to improvement is clear. By <em>breaking down</em> complex skills, providing <em>structured learning</em> paths, and <em>respecting</em> cognitive limitations, organisations can dramatically reduce the time it takes for new hires to become productive team members.

    "title": "🔀 Cross-Platform Builds In Python",
    "url": "/posts/py-cross-compile.html",
    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Creating cross-platform Python application packages requires CI/CD solutions like GitHub Actions since tools like PyInstaller can’t natively build for multiple platforms; alternatives like Julia and Elixir offer promising but still-maturing packaging options, while Deno emerges as an appealing alternative with its straightforward cross-platform packaging capabilities, lightweight footprint, and growing data ecosystem- though Python remains dominant for data analysis despite its packaging limitations.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nIn the last couple of years I’ve spoken to 3-4 people who had needed a bespoke data analysis tool that could be used locally, with privacy in mind. In some cases they’d need to work in a sandboxed environment for security reasons, other times they had IP protection concerns. A desktop app or a CLI tool[^1] seemed to fit the bill in all those cases.\\ In the last decade+, Data and Python have become a synonym. <a href=\"https://pyinstaller.org/\">PyInstaller</a> seemed like an obvious choice. However, PyInstaller cannot cross-compile code as it stands. Being a <em>Linux</em> user, offering to help <em>Windows</em> users, meant I should find a workaround e.g. leveraging GitHub Actions for cross-compilation.</p>\n<h2>\nTaking The Scenic Route</h2>\n<p>\nOut of curiosity, I decided to have a poke around a couple of different languages and ecosystems that could teach me a few things while helping me understand what is a viable alternative to Python.</p>\n<h3>\nJulia</h3>\n<p>\nThe <a href=\"https://julialang.org/\">Julia</a> programming language has caught my eye since 2014. It partially reminded me of MATLAB, that I used for my PhD. Familiarity aside, it’s a great language to develop with. It’s fast, interactive, with the best REPL I’ve encountered, highly promising overall especially so after the release of Julia v1.9.\\ To my understanding Julia, being a JIT compiled language, wasn’t designed for static compilation per se. Community efforts have enabled the generation of compiled packages, with <a href=\"https://binarybuilder.org/\">BinaryBuilder</a>, <a href=\"https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl\">PackageCompiler</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/tshort/StaticCompiler.jl\">StaticCompiler</a> being the most well known compilation tools available at the time of writing. From an intermediate Julia user’s point of view, I’ve found that compilation results may vary. Also, to the best of my knowledge most compilation tools actually <em>package</em> code rather than statically compile it, which may expose valuable IP. Therefore, I concluded that Julia <em>probably</em> isn’t as easy to compile as I initially thought (and hoped).</p>\n<h3>\nElixir</h3>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://elixir-lang.org/\">Elixir</a> is a fantastic hosted functional language, running on the tried and tested <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine)\">BEAM (Erlang VM)</a>. One of the many things Elixir has going for it, is its strong drive towards <em>good</em> documentation. The language’s REPL is also excellent. All in all, Elixir is rapidly evolving and it’s worth experimenting with.\\ Starting from 2021, <a href=\"https://github.com/elixir-nx\">Numerical Elixir (Nx)</a> has progressed by leaps and bounds. The Nx community has managed to produce excellent libraries, with <a href=\"https://livebook.dev/\">Livebook</a> being the best literate programming environment I’ve ever used. As far as data applications are concerned, Elixir will become a <em>very strong</em> contender, it’s well worth keeping a close eye on the language.\\ As for cross-compilation, to my understanding <a href=\"https://hex.pm/packages/burrito\">Burrito</a> is the only tool that allows for packaged Elixir code to be truly portable albeit producing sizeable executables. Burrito is still WIP, not a guaranteed solution for the time being but a noteworthy tool that’s improving fast.\\ Being doubtful as to whether this tech stack could meet all my current needs, beside being a niche language in Data and AI, led me to search for another tech stack for fun and profit.</p>\n<h3>\nDeno (TypeScript)</h3>\n",

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Ternary-weighted LLMs using only {-1, 0, 1} values (1.58 bits) can match full-precision performance while delivering dramatic efficiency improvements: 2.71x faster inference, 2.55x lower memory usage, and 71.4x lower energy consumption for matrix operations at 3B parameter scale.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nBack in February 2024, a preprint titled <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764\">The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits</a> was released. Lots of people picked up on it, simply search for <em>1.58-bits</em> on YouTube for instance, however it escaped me due to <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/AdamMGrant/status/1851348990589354464\">a busy time at work</a>. It was only when I stumbled across this preprint again recently, that I realised what a fantastic idea it is to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCDGiys-nLA\">substitute multiplication with addition or subtraction</a>.</p>\n<h2>\nContributions</h2>\n<p>\nThe TL;DR is that all LLM weights can be ternary i.e. {-1, 0, 1}. Ternary weights are 1.58-bits. Activations are 8-bits. This highly quantised model matches full-precision performance at 3B parameter scale.\\ This highly quantised model exhibits 2.71x faster inference, 2.55x lower memory usage at 3B scale, 71.4x lower energy consumption for matrix multiplication operations. Benefits increase with model scale e.g. 4.1x speed-up at 70B parameters, 8.9x higher throughput, 11x larger batch size.</p>\n<h2>\nWhat Does 1.58-bits Mean?</h2>\n<p>\nCarnegie Mellon University has a great reference on the <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Tutorials/Info-Theory/\">basics of Information theory</a>. Learning how to measure information content for a ternary system {-1, 0, 1}, we notice that:\\ Each value {-1, 0, 1} has an equal probability $P = \\frac{1}{3}$ for each state. The information content is $-(P \\log_2{P})$ summed over all states</p>\n<p>\n$$ -(\\frac{1}{3} \\log_2(\\frac{1}{3}) + \\frac{1}{3} \\log_2(\\frac{1}{3}) + \\frac{1}{3} \\log_2(\\frac{1}{3})) = -(3 × (\\frac{1}{3} \\log_2(\\frac{1}{3}))) = -\\log_2(\\frac{1}{3}) \\approx 1.58496… bits $$</p>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nLLMs can achieve comparable performance to full-precision models while using only three weight values {-1, 0, 1}, achieving up to 71.4x lower energy consumption for matrix operations and 3.55x lower memory usage at 3B scale. This breakthrough suggests a new direction for efficient LLM deployment, particularly promising for edge devices and mobile applications, while also opening opportunities for specialized hardware optimized for 1-bit operations.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>\n<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Despite larger LLM context windows, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains essential for information curation, data provenance, and overcoming the “lost in the middle” effect where models struggle with information placed centrally in long contexts-making careful retrieval strategies more valuable than simply dumping large amounts of text into expanded context windows.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<h2>\nIntroduction</h2>\n<p>\nThis morning I noticed that <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/simonw/status/1850928417363149049\">Simon Willison shared some views on RAG</a>, <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/burkov/status/1851159933913280647\">Andryi Burkov criticised</a> people who claim that RAG is obsolete, and other RAG-related discussions taking place sparked by recent longer LLM context windows. Below I’m sharing some thoughts based on personal experience.</p>\n<h2>\nRAG</h2>\n<p>\nRAG is not simply a workaround to context limits, it’s a way to carefully curate information and data. It enables provenance and visibility of the data flowing through an LLM pipeline -compared to fine-tuning which bakes knowledge into the model itself. Importantly, RAG is not a synonym of embeddings. Embedding text is a fantastic way to enable semantic search, especially if it is done in a smart way (word, sentence, paragraph, or document) given project needs.\\ I have successfully reused existing infrastructure to provide one of the largest companies in the world with the ability to quickly retrieve information through Q &amp; A. To achieve this, in the context of simplicity and leveraging existing infrastructure, I opted against adding moving parts like a Vector DB. Instead, I used plain JSON objects and an agentic system to meet the client’s needs. It worked very well, with feedback from higher management being “<em><strong>thank you</strong>, this is mind-blowing</em>“.\\ A nice overview of RAG comes from <a href=\"https://www.latent.space/p/llamaindex\">Jerry Liu’s interview on Latent Space</a>.\\ <em>Update: a useful open-source tool for <a href=\"https://github.com/Brandon-c-tech/RAG-logger\">RAGLogging</a> just came out.</em></p>\n<h2>\nU-Shaped Performance</h2>\n<p>\nOne LLM behaviour that should be considered, before regarding RAG obsolete, is their tendency to attend to information from the beginning and end of the context window. See <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172\">Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts</a> for an empirical analysis.\\ The paper concludes</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\nWe empirically study how language models use long input contexts via a series &gt; of controlled experiments. We show that language model performance degrades &gt; significantly when changing the position of relevant information, indicating &gt; that models struggle to robustly access and use information in long input &gt; contexts. In particular, performance is often lowest when models must use &gt; information in the middle of long input contexts.We conduct a preliminary &gt; investigation of the role of (i) model architecture, (ii) query-aware &gt; contextualisation, and (iii) instruction fine-tuning to better understand how &gt; they affect how language models use context. Finally, we conclude with a &gt; practical case study of open-domain question answering,finding that the &gt; performance of language model readers saturates far before retriever recall. &gt; Our results and analysis provide a better understanding of how language models &gt; use their input context and provides new evaluation protocols for future &gt; long-context models.\\ &gt; In other words, simply dumping loads of text or embeddings into an LLM with a &gt; big context window -say 2M tokens- won’t yield great results. There’s more to &gt; it than brute forcing.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nExtending context length, as appealing as it may sound, neither simplifies nor solves the issue of creating a good quality AI system that is enriched by large text corpora. It seems that when it comes to larger data volumes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e1Wzbr8wGU\">semantic search augmented with Graph search</a> could be a more robust, albeit more involved, approach. Solid prompt engineering approaches, including <a href=\"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot\">Chain-of-Thought</a>, <a href=\"https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot\">Few-shot prompting</a> etc. are also powerful tools to keep in our toolbox.</p>\n",

Premium</code></pre>\n<p>\nIt looks like the only ID containing a video <em>with</em> audio, is <code class=\"inline\">18</code>, i.e. a 420p, 640x360 video according to my media player. This might be sufficient for a video like the above, but such low resolution would make it almost impossible to read code or smaller writing.</p>\n<h2>\nMy Solution</h2>\n<p>\nGiven I have started leveraging Deno for my needs, I wrote a small tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/ai-mindset/yt-dlp-hq\">yt-dlp-hq</a>. It’s certainly basic, with lots of room for improvement. However it does exactly what I need and I’m relatively happy with the result, pending some improvements[^1].\\ Deno is great for cross-compilation. Also, GitHub Actions can be a good method for automating testing, running, compiling etc.[^2] Is it though? Let’s see.</p>\n<h2>\nMy CI Pipeline</h2>\n<p>\nI started off by using <a href=\"https://nektosact.com/introduction.html\">act</a>, a very nice tool that allows for testing pipelines locally. The main downside I found was that for an intermediate Docker user with little <code class=\"inline\">act</code> experience, sometimes GitHub Actions don’t behave the same way locally as they would online. Also, I like <a href=\"https://podman.io/\">podman</a> considerably better, since it’s daemonless and not as resource-hungry among others.\\ Putting <code class=\"inline\">act</code> aside, I focused on setting up a <a href=\"https://github.com/ai-mindset/yt-dlp-hq/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml\">pipeline</a> that’d work well enough with every new PR opened against <code class=\"inline\">main</code> aside from others.\\ The pipeline ran successfully, where in theory it built and released <code class=\"inline\">yt-dlp-hq</code> executables. However, when I downloaded the corresponding executable for my OS and CPU architecture, it did not run. When I locally built the same set of executables, running <code class=\"inline\">deno task build</code>, the executable for my OS &amp; arch worked as expected. This made me wonder whether I’m doing something wrong, if it’s a GitHub Action intricacy or some other issue I needed to resolve. Inspired by Medicine, I tried approaching the issue through differential diagnosis, which to my understanding works by excluding other causes in order to hone in on the actual medical condition. I.e. I first created a release directory locally. I then manually created a release on GitHub. To my dismay, the executable I manually uploaded didn’t run when I downloaded it back from GitHub. This made me wonder if there is a conversion involved when a pipeline generates executables or the user uploads them manually for release. Spoiler alert: I still don’t know if that’s the case, but I suspect that GitHub indeed doesn’t save executables without some change taking place during upload.</p>\n<h3>\nFixing Executables GitHub Release</h3>\n<p>\nInitially, I changed the following setting on my repository:\\ <em>“Settings -&gt; Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Workflow permissions”</em> select <em>“Read and write permissions”</em>. Then, I experimented with compressing each generated executable into a .tar file. This did the trick. Simply compressing an executable is enough to maintain its function. Thus, the way to install <code class=\"inline\">yt-dlp-hq</code> takes one extra step.\\ For example, if you’re a Linux user on an Intel-based machine, here’s how you can use my tool</p>\n<pre><code class=\"console\">$ curl -L -O https://github.com/ai-mindset/yt-dlp-hq/releases/download/1.0.0/yt-dlp-hq-intel-linux.tar &amp;&amp; tar xvf yt-dlp-hq-intel-linux.tar &amp;&amp; cd release\n$ ./yt-dlp-hq-intel-linux https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</code></pre>\n<h2>\nConclusion</h2>\n<p>\nI’m glad I learned something more about GitHub and Actions, its idiosyncrasies and abilities. It took me a couple days, which made me consider the benefits of <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1319/\">automation</a>. Being more minimalistic, I tend to opt for simple automation when possible <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1205/\"><em>if</em> it’s worth it</a>. To quote <a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis\">Alan Perlis</a>, “<em>Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it</em>“.</p>\n<hr class=\"thin\">\n<p>\n[^1]: Some improvements I’m planning include unit testing, automatic audio &amp;</p>\n<pre><code>video ID selection and possibly automatic FFmpeg installation when it&#39;s not\navailable in `$PATH`.</code></pre>\n<p>\n[^2]: A <a href=\"https://julialang.org/\">Juiia</a> enthusiast introduced me to</p>\n<pre><code>[Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) and\n[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/).

Below is a chatsheet I put together with the help of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It covers basic syntax, it’s by no means complete or exhaustive. However it gives a first taste of the similarities and differences between the two languages. The reason I am looking into TypeScript is explained in my <a href=\"../deno/\">Deno article</a>.</p>\n<h2>\nVariables And Data Types</h2>\n<p>\n| Concept | Python                                 | TypeScript                                                               | | ——- | ————————————– | ———————————————————————— | | Int     | <code class=\"inline\">x = 5</code>                                | <code class=\"inline\">let x: number = 5;</code>                                                     | | Float   | <code class=\"inline\">y = 3.14</code>                             | <code class=\"inline\">let y: number = 3.14;</code>                                                  | | Str     | <code class=\"inline\">name = &quot;John&quot;</code>                        | <code class=\"inline\">let name: string = &quot;John&quot;;</code>                                             | | Bool    | <code class=\"inline\">is_valid = True</code>                      | <code class=\"inline\">let isValid: boolean = true;</code>                                           | | List    | <code class=\"inline\">numbers = [1, 2, 3]</code>                  | <code class=\"inline\">let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];</code>                                     | | Dict    | <code class=\"inline\">person = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30}</code> | <code class=\"inline\">let person: { name: string; age: number } = { name: &quot;John&quot;, age: 30 };</code> |</p>\n<h2>\nFunctions</h2>\n<p>\n| Concept     | Python                         | TypeScript                               | | ———– | —————————— | —————————————- | | Func def    | <code class=\"inline\">def greet(name: str) -&gt; str:</code> | <code class=\"inline\">function greet(name: string): string {</code> | | Func return | <code class=\"inline\">return f&quot;Hello, {name}!&quot;</code>     | <code class=\"inline\">return `Hello, ${name}!`;</code>            | | Lambda      | <code class=\"inline\">lambda x: x * 2</code>              | <code class=\"inline\">(x: number): number =&gt; x * 2</code>           |</p>\n<h2>\nClasses</h2>\n<p>\n| Concept       | Python                                     | TypeScript                                 | | ————- | —————————————— | —————————————— | | Class def     | <code class=\"inline\">class Person:</code>                            | <code class=\"inline\">class Person {</code>                           | | Constructor   | <code class=\"inline\">def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):</code> | <code class=\"inline\">constructor(name: string, age: number) {</code> | | Instance vars | <code class=\"inline\">self.name = name</code>                         | <code class=\"inline\">this.name = name;</code>                        | |               | <code class=\"inline\">self.age = age</code>                           | <code class=\"inline\">this.age = age;</code>                          | | Method def    | <code class=\"inline\">def greet(self) -&gt; str:</code>                  | <code class=\"inline\">greet(): string {</code>                        | | Method return | <code class=\"inline\">return f&quot;Hello, I&#39;m {self.name}!&quot;</code>        | <code class=\"inline\">return `Hello, I&#39;m ${this.name}!`;</code>     |</p>\n<h2>\nControl Flow</h2>\n<p>\n| Concept    | Python               | TypeScript                      | | ———- | ——————– | ——————————- | | If         | <code class=\"inline\">if x &gt; 0:</code>          | <code class=\"inline\">if (x &gt; 0) {</code>                  | | Else if    | <code class=\"inline\">elif x &lt; 0:</code>        | <code class=\"inline\">} else if (x &lt; 0) {</code>           | | Else       | <code class=\"inline\">else:</code>              | <code class=\"inline\">} else {</code>                      | | For loop   | <code class=\"inline\">for i in range(5):</code> | <code class=\"inline\">for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {</code> | | While loop | <code class=\"inline\">while x &gt; 0:</code>       | <code class=\"inline\">while (x &gt; 0) {</code>               |</p>\n<h2>\nError Handling</h2>\n<p>\n| Concept      | Python                      | TypeScript          | | ———— | ————————— | ——————- | | Try          | <code class=\"inline\">try:</code>                      | <code class=\"inline\">try {</code>             | | Except/Catch | <code class=\"inline\">except ZeroDivisionError:</code> | <code class=\"inline\">} catch (error) {</code> | | Finally      | <code class=\"inline\">finally:</code>                  | <code class=\"inline\">} finally {</code>       |</p>\n",
