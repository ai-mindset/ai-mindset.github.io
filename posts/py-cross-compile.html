<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Creating cross-platform Python application packages requires CI/CD solutions like GitHub Actions since tools like PyInstaller can’t natively build for multiple platforms; alternatives like Julia and Elixir offer promising but still-maturing packaging options, while Deno emerges as an appealing alternative with its straightforward cross-platform packaging capabilities, lightweight footprint, and growing data ecosystem- though Python remains dominant for data analysis despite its packaging limitations.</p>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<p>
In the last couple of years I’ve spoken to 3-4 people who had needed a bespoke data analysis tool that could be used locally, with privacy in mind. In some cases they’d need to work in a sandboxed environment for security reasons, other times they had IP protection concerns. A desktop app or a CLI tool[^1] seemed to fit the bill in all those cases.\ In the last decade+, Data and Python have become a synonym. <a href="https://pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a> seemed like an obvious choice. However, PyInstaller cannot cross-compile code as it stands. Being a <em>Linux</em> user, offering to help <em>Windows</em> users, meant I should find a workaround e.g. leveraging GitHub Actions for cross-compilation.</p>
<h2>
Taking The Scenic Route</h2>
<p>
Out of curiosity, I decided to have a poke around a couple of different languages and ecosystems that could teach me a few things while helping me understand what is a viable alternative to Python.</p>
<h3>
Julia</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> programming language has caught my eye since 2014. It partially reminded me of MATLAB, that I used for my PhD. Familiarity aside, it’s a great language to develop with. It’s fast, interactive, with the best REPL I’ve encountered, highly promising overall especially so after the release of Julia v1.9.\ To my understanding Julia, being a JIT compiled language, wasn’t designed for static compilation per se. Community efforts have enabled the generation of compiled packages, with <a href="https://binarybuilder.org/">BinaryBuilder</a>, <a href="https://julialang.github.io/PackageCompiler.jl">PackageCompiler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tshort/StaticCompiler.jl">StaticCompiler</a> being the most well known compilation tools available at the time of writing. From an intermediate Julia user’s point of view, I’ve found that compilation results may vary. Also, to the best of my knowledge most compilation tools actually <em>package</em> code rather than statically compile it, which may expose valuable IP. Therefore, I concluded that Julia <em>probably</em> isn’t as easy to compile as I initially thought (and hoped).</p>
<h3>
Elixir</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> is a fantastic hosted functional language, running on the tried and tested <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine)">BEAM (Erlang VM)</a>. One of the many things Elixir has going for it, is its strong drive towards <em>good</em> documentation. The language’s REPL is also excellent. All in all, Elixir is rapidly evolving and it’s worth experimenting with.\ Starting from 2021, <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx">Numerical Elixir (Nx)</a> has progressed by leaps and bounds. The Nx community has managed to produce excellent libraries, with <a href="https://livebook.dev/">Livebook</a> being the best literate programming environment I’ve ever used. As far as data applications are concerned, Elixir will become a <em>very strong</em> contender, it’s well worth keeping a close eye on the language.\ As for cross-compilation, to my understanding <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/burrito">Burrito</a> is the only tool that allows for packaged Elixir code to be truly portable albeit producing sizeable executables. Burrito is still WIP, not a guaranteed solution for the time being but a noteworthy tool that’s improving fast.\ Being doubtful as to whether this tech stack could meet all my current needs, beside being a niche language in Data and AI, led me to search for another tech stack for fun and profit.</p>
