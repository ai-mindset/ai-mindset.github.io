        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Patrick Lencioni&#39;s &quot;The Advantage&quot; argues that organisational health-built through leadership teams founded on trust, clear communication, and aligned values-is the single greatest competitive advantage companies can achieve, outweighing traditional &quot;smart&quot; business strategies and metrics for sustainable long-term success.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently I listened to a <a href="https://saasscalingsecrets.buzzsprout.com/2172375/episodes/15926541-why-slower-growth-could-be-your-fast-track-to-success-with-roan-lavery-ceo-of-freeagent">successful company&#39;s CEO interview</a>, where he explained how growing sustainably contributed to the company&#39;s success. The CEO said that their growth strategy was inspired by <a href="https://www.tablegroup.com/pat/">Patrick Lencioni</a>&#39;s book <a href="https://www.tablegroup.com/product/the-advantage/">The Advantage</a>. I found the book&#39;s premise very interesting, hence I&#39;ll attempt to summarise important points as a note to self.</p>
<h2 id="central-thesis">Central Thesis</h2>
<p>Organisational health is the <em>single greatest competitive advantage</em> a company can achieve, yet it&#39;s often overlooked in favour of &quot;smart&quot; business decisions.</p>
<h2 id="key-components-of-organisational-health">Key components of organisational health</h2>

</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="critical-success-factors">Critical success factors</h3>

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The book&#39;s fundamental message is that creating a healthy organisation through strong leadership, clear communication, and aligned values is more important than traditional business metrics for long-term success. It&#39;s not about being the &quot;smartest&quot; in the market, but about creating the healthiest internal environment.</p>
