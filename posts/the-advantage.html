<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Patrick Lencioni’s “The Advantage” argues that organisational health-built through leadership teams founded on trust, clear communication, and aligned values-is the single greatest competitive advantage companies can achieve, outweighing traditional “smart” business strategies and metrics for sustainable long-term success.</p>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<p>
Recently I listened to a <a href="https://saasscalingsecrets.buzzsprout.com/2172375/episodes/15926541-why-slower-growth-could-be-your-fast-track-to-success-with-roan-lavery-ceo-of-freeagent">successful company’s CEO interview</a>, where he explained how growing sustainably contributed to the company’s success. The CEO said that their growth strategy was inspired by <a href="https://www.tablegroup.com/pat/">Patrick Lencioni</a>‘s book <a href="https://www.tablegroup.com/product/the-advantage/">The Advantage</a>. I found the book’s premise very interesting, hence I’ll attempt to summarise important points as a note to self.</p>
<h2>
Central Thesis</h2>
<p>
Organisational health is the <em>single greatest competitive advantage</em> a company can achieve, yet it’s often overlooked in favour of “smart” business decisions.</p>
<h2>
Key components of organisational health</h2>
<h3>
Leadership team structure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Optimal size: 3-10 people  </li>
  <li>
Built on trust and vulnerability  </li>
  <li>
Values collective success over individual achievement  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
Core principles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Trust and vulnerability as foundations  </li>
  <li>
Accountability at all levels  </li>
  <li>
Commitment to collective goals  </li>
  <li>
Clear communication and expectations  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
Operational excellence</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Regular, focused meetings with specific purposes  </li>
  <li>
Clear distinction between strategic and tactical discussions  </li>
  <li>
Emphasis on debate and healthy conflict resolution  </li>
  <li>
Continuous progress monitoring  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
People and culture</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Hire for cultural fit rather than training after hiring  </li>
  <li>
Focus on values alignment in recruitment  </li>
  <li>
Reward behaviour that aligns with organisational values  </li>
  <li>
Foster an environment of open communication  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
Critical success factors</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
Minimal internal politics  </li>
  <li>
High clarity in communication  </li>
  <li>
Clear decision-making processes  </li>
  <li>
Low employee turnover  </li>
  <li>
High morale and productivity  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The book’s fundamental message is that creating a healthy organisation through strong leadership, clear communication, and aligned values is more important than traditional business metrics for long-term success. It’s not about being the “smartest” in the market, but about creating the healthiest internal environment.</p>
