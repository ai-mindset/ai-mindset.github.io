<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Anthropic’s approach to system prompt development parallels test-driven development-first creating test cases where default model behaviour fails, then developing prompts that pass these tests, followed by iterative refinement-highlighting how robust automated evaluation is not merely a quality check but the foundation for building reliable LLM applications.</p>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<p>
2024 has made clear that writing good automated evaluations for LLM-powered systems is the most critical skill for building useful applications. This insight parallels Anthropic’s internal approach to system prompt development. As usual, Simon Willison’s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#evals-really-matter">recent insightful 2024 LLM overview</a> was a treasure trove. One item I picked up on was evaluating system prompts using a test-driven approach.</p>
<h2>
The Evaluation-First Approach</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://askell.io/">Amanda Askell</a>, leading fine-tuning at Anthropic, <a href="https://xcancel.com/amandaaskell/status/1866207266761760812">outlines a test-driven process</a> for system prompts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Create a test set of messages where the model’s default behaviour fails to  </li>
  <li>
Develop a system prompt that passes these tests  </li>
  <li>
Identify cases where the system prompt is misapplied and refine it  </li>
  <li>
Expand the test set and repeat    <br>
meet requirements  </li>
</ol>
<p>
This methodology’s importance extends beyond prompt engineering. Companies with strong evaluation suites can adopt new models faster and build more reliable features than competitors. As <a href="https://xcancel.com/cramforce/status/1860436022347075667">Vercel’s experience demonstrates</a>, moving from complex prompt protection to robust testing enables rapid iteration and development.</p>
<h2>
Conclusion</h2>
<p>
While everyone acknowledges evals’ importance, implementing them effectively remains challenging. The key insight is clear: robust automated evaluation isn’t just a quality check, it’s the foundation for building reliable LLM-powered systems.</p>
