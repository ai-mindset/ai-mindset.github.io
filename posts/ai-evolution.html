        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This historical overview traces AI&#39;s evolution through four major
paradigms: from symbolic reasoning and expert systems (1950s-1970s), through
neural networks and Bayesian approaches (1980s-1990s), to the Big Data
revolution (2000s-2010s), culminating in today&#39;s integrated systems that combine
multiple philosophical approaches-suggesting future progress requires unifying
these diverse methodologies rather than choosing between them.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The field of Artificial Intelligence has undergone several paradigm shifts since
its inception, each representing a distinct approach to creating intelligent
systems. Drawing from Pedro Domingos&#39; framework in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm">The Master Algorithm</a> we
can trace how different schools of thought have shaped our understanding and
implementation of AI technologies.</p>
<h2 id="historical-evolution">Historical Evolution</h2>
<h3 id="early-foundations-symbolic-ai-and-expert-systems-1950s-1970s">Early Foundations: Symbolic AI and Expert Systems (1950s-1970s)</h3>
<p>The pioneers of AI began with symbolic reasoning, believing intelligence could
be reduced to symbol manipulation. This <em>symbolist</em> approach offered explicit
reasoning chains and interpretability but struggled with real-world complexity.
Expert Systems followed, successfully applying rule-based reasoning to narrow
domains while revealing the challenges of scaling knowledge-based systems.</p>
<h3 id="the-rise-of-neural-approaches-1980s-1990s">The Rise of Neural Approaches (1980s-1990s)</h3>
<p>The <em>connectionist</em> movement emerged with neural networks, drawing inspiration
from biological systems. This era introduced pattern recognition capabilities
and learning from examples. Simultaneously, the <em>Bayesian</em> school brought
statistical methods to the forefront, offering principled approaches to handling
uncertainty but requiring significant data and computational resources.</p>
<h3 id="the-data-revolution-2000s-2010s">The Data Revolution (2000s-2010s)</h3>
<p>Big Data and Deep Learning foundations emerged as the <em>analogiser</em> school gained
prominence. This period saw the convergence of massive datasets, computational
power, and sophisticated architectures. Deep Learning breakthrough demonstrated
the power of automatic feature learning, though at the cost of increased
computational demands and reduced interpretability.</p>
<h3 id="contemporary-ai-the-era-of-integration-2020s">Contemporary AI: The Era of Integration (2020s)</h3>
<p>Current AI systems, particularly large language models, represent a synthesis of
multiple schools. They combine symbolic reasoning[^1], neural architectures[^2],
and statistical learning[^3], achieving impressive generative capabilities and
few-shot learning. However, they face challenges in resource requirements,
reliability, and alignment with human values. A nicely distilled overview of
what is today&#39;s AI, comes from an

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The evolution of AI reveals a field shaped by competing philosophies, each
contributing essential insights. As Domingos argues, the future likely lies not
in the dominance of any single approach but in their unification. While recent
advances demonstrate the potential of synthesising different methods,
significant challenges remain in creating truly intelligent systems that are
both powerful and reliable.</p>
<p>The path forward requires building on these foundations while addressing core
challenges in efficiency, interpretability, and alignment. Rather than choosing
between different schools of thought, the field must continue to integrate their
strengths while mitigating their individual weaknesses.</p>
<hr>
<p>[^1]: Symbolic reasoning in modern AI manifests through attention mechanisms and
    transformers&#39; ability to process structured input like code or mathematical
    expressions. While not explicitly rule-based like early AI, these systems
    can learn and apply symbolic patterns.</p>
<p>[^2]: Neural architectures in contemporary AI primarily use the transformer
    architecture, where self-attention layers process information in parallel,
    allowing the model to weigh the importance of different inputs contextually.</p>
<p>[^3]: Statistical learning appears in the form of probabilistic token prediction
    and the use of large-scale statistical patterns learned during training.
    Models learn probability distributions over sequences, enabling them to
    generate coherent outputs.</p>
