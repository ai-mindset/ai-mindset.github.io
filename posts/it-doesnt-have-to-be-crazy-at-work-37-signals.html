        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Basecamp founders reject the &quot;crazy busy&quot; workplace culture, advocating instead for a &quot;calm company&quot; approach that emphasises reasonable 40-hour workweeks, focused attention, asynchronous communication, and flexible project scope - proving that sustainable work practices can yield successful businesses without sacrificing employee wellbeing.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In today&#39;s hyperactive business environment, &quot;crazy busy&quot; has become a badge of honour. Endless workweeks, constant interruptions, and the expectation of instant responses have created workplaces where stress is the norm and burnout is inevitable. But does it have to be this way? <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason">Jason Fried</a> and <a href="https://world.hey.com/david">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, the founders of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basecamp_(company)&redirect=no">Basecamp</a> (renamed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37signals">37signals</a> since 2014), argue emphatically that it doesn&#39;t. In their book &quot;<a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm">It Doesn&#39;t Have to Be Crazy at Work</a>&quot; they present a compelling case for a calmer, more sustainable approach to work -one where companies can still be successful without sacrificing the well-being of their employees.\ The authors, who have built a profitable business with minimal stress and reasonable working hours, dismiss the idea that growth-at-all-costs and around-the-clock work schedules are necessary for success. Instead, they advocate for what they call a &quot;calm company&quot; -an organisation that values sustainable workloads, reasonable expectations, sufficient rest, and focused productivity. Let&#39;s dive into the key principles that can help transform a frantic workplace into a calm and productive environment.</p>
<h2 id="the-calm-company-philosophy">The Calm Company Philosophy</h2>
<h3 id="rethinking-time-and-attention">Rethinking Time and Attention</h3>
<p>One of the core insights from the book is that modern workplaces have become &quot;interruption factories&quot; where meaningful work is nearly impossible. Offices chop the workday into tiny fragments -fifteen minutes here, ten minutes there- with meetings, calls, and constant distractions preventing sustained focus.\ The authors argue that 8-hour workdays and 40-hour workweeks are plenty of time to accomplish great work, provided that time is actually protected. Instead of measuring commitment by hours spent at a desk, a calm company measures results and respects boundaries. Basecamp&#39;s philosophy is straightforward: &quot;Work 40 hours a week, then stop. No all-nighters, no weekends&quot;.\ To protect time, the book advocates for asynchronous communication whenever possible. Not everything requires an immediate response. By promoting a culture of eventual response rather than instant reaction, companies give employees the space for deep, focused work. This might mean designating &quot;library rules&quot; in the office -quiet, focused concentration- and setting clear boundaries for when real-time collaboration is truly necessary.</p>
<h3 id="eliminate-excessive-mms-meetings-and-managers">Eliminate Excessive M&amp;Ms: Meetings and Managers</h3>
<p>Meetings and micromanagement are two primary culprits behind workplace chaos. The authors are particularly critical of the modern meeting culture, noting that &quot;a one-hour meeting with ten people isn&#39;t a one-hour meeting -it&#39;s a ten-hour meeting&quot;. Before calling a meeting, they suggest asking whether it&#39;s truly worth pulling multiple people away from their focused work.\ Similarly, the book challenges managers to stop &quot;managing the chairs&quot; (monitoring when people arrive and leave) and instead focus on managing the work itself. This means setting clear expectations, providing necessary resources, removing obstacles, and then trusting people to execute without constant supervision.\ At Basecamp, they&#39;ve institutionalised practices like &quot;office hours&quot; for experts, where rather than being constantly available for interruption, they designate specific times when they&#39;re available for questions. They&#39;ve also moved away from real-time chat for important discussions, recognising that this medium often creates an unhealthy expectation of immediate response.</p>
<h3 id="reasonable-expectations-and-focused-scope">Reasonable Expectations and Focused Scope</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most radical departure from conventional business thinking is the authors&#39; approach to goals and expectations. They proudly declare: &quot;We don&#39;t do goals at Basecamp&quot;. Instead of chasing arbitrary targets, they focus on doing excellent work consistently and sustainably.\ The book introduces the concept of &quot;dreadlines&quot; versus deadlines. A dreadline appears when a deadline is paired with an ever-expanding scope. To combat this, Basecamp keeps deadlines fixed but makes scope flexible. Projects can only get smaller over time, not larger, ensuring teams can deliver quality work without burning out.\ This means being deliberate about what not to do. As the authors put it: &quot;Having less to do isn&#39;t a problem, it&#39;s an advantage&quot;. They suggest developing the skill of &quot;narrowing as you go&quot; -starting projects with exploration, then gradually focusing in on what&#39;s truly important as you approach the deadline.\ Basecamp also embraces the &quot;disagree and commit&quot; approach to decision-making. Rather than requiring consensus, which can lead to endless debate, someone makes the final call after everyone has been heard -and then the whole team commits to making it work, even if some initially disagreed.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-healthy-remote-work-culture">Building a Healthy Remote Work Culture</h3>
<p>Remote work features prominently in Basecamp&#39;s approach to building a calm company. By removing the expectation that everyone must be in the same physical space, they&#39;ve created more flexibility while maintaining productivity.\ However, they emphasise that remote work requires intentionality. Teams need sufficient overlap in working hours, clear communication practices, and strong writing skills. In fact, the authors consider good writing essential for remote teams, as it eliminates ambiguity and creates a clear record of decisions and rationales.\ The authors also address the concern that remote work might lead to isolation or disconnection. They recommend regular in-person meetups[^1] and maintaining a strong company culture based on shared values and respect, not forced socialisation or perks designed to keep people at the office longer.</p>
<h3 id="hiring-and-benefits-that-support-life-outside-work">Hiring and Benefits That Support Life Outside Work</h3>
<p>Basecamp&#39;s approach to hiring focuses on finding talented people who value calm productivity over chaotic hustle. Their compensation philosophy is refreshingly straightforward: equal pay for equal work, regardless of location, with no complex negotiation processes.\ Their benefits are specifically designed to encourage life beyond work. Rather than offering free meals to keep employees in the office longer, they provide benefits that help people disconnect -like paid sabbaticals, summer hours (32-hour workweeks from May through August), and even covering the cost of employees&#39; vacations. This reinforces their belief that the best workers are well-rested ones with rich lives outside the office.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>&quot;It Doesn&#39;t Have to Be Crazy at Work&quot; presents a refreshing alternative to the burnout culture that pervades much of today&#39;s business world. The calm company model isn&#39;t about doing less or lowering standards -it&#39;s about working smarter, focusing on what truly matters, and creating sustainable conditions where people can do their best work without sacrificing their health and happiness.</p>
<p>The key takeaways from the book include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect people&#39;s time and attention by eliminating unnecessary interruptions</li>
<li>Stick to reasonable work hours (40 hours per week is plenty)</li>
<li>Replace constant meetings with more thoughtful, asynchronous communication</li>
<li>Focus on the quality of work rather than hours logged</li>
<li>Keep deadlines fixed but be flexible about scope</li>
<li>Build a culture of trust where remote work can thrive</li>
<li>Be intentional about what you say no to</li>
</ol>
<p>As the authors suggest, &quot;calm is contagious&quot; -and so is crazy. By choosing calm, companies can create environments where employees thrive, creativity flourishes, and sustainable success becomes possible. The choice, as they say, is yours.</p>
<hr>
<p>[^1]: Reasonable adjustments must be considered for those who are not able to
    travel far due to health, family or other reasons beyond their control. It
    is possible to build and maintain a strong culture that does not necessitate
    travelling, or at least not travelling often or far, if circumstances don&#39;t
    allow.</p>
