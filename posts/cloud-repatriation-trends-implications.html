        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Cloud repatriation is gaining momentum with 86% of CIOs planning to
move some workloads back on-premises, driven by unexpected costs, performance
needs, security concerns, and desire for greater control - though most
organisations are adopting hybrid approaches rather than abandoning cloud
entirely, strategically placing workloads where they function most efficiently.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The last decade has witnessed the meteoric rise of cloud computing, with
organisations large and small migrating their data, applications, and
infrastructure to public cloud environments. The promises were compelling:
reduced capital expenditure, unlimited scalability, enhanced flexibility, and
access to cutting-edge technologies without the overhead of managing physical
infrastructure. However, a notable countertrend has emerged in recent years
-cloud repatriation. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as &quot;reverse cloud
migration,&quot; involves moving workloads, applications, and data back from public
cloud environments to on-premises data centres, private clouds, or hybrid setups
(<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International, 2023</a>).
I&#39;ve previously explored this topic in my article [The On-Prem Comeback (aka
Cloud Repatriation)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
_posts/2024-11-14-cloud-repatriation.md %}), where I introduced the basic
concepts and early examples of this trend.<br>This article explores the growing cloud repatriation movement, examining why
organisations and individuals are reconsidering their cloud-first strategies,
the key drivers behind these decisions, and how they&#39;re implementing these
transitions to achieve more balanced and optimised IT infrastructures.</p>
<h2 id="the-scale-of-the-cloud-repatriation-movement">The Scale of the Cloud Repatriation Movement</h2>
<p>The repatriation trend is not isolated but represents a significant shift in how
organisations approach their IT infrastructure strategy. According to a 2021
survey by IDC cited by
<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>,
80% of organisations reported repatriating workloads or data from public cloud
environments. More recent data from the end of 2024 showed that 86% of CIOs
planned to move some public cloud workloads back to private cloud or on-premises
-the highest on record for the Barclays CIO Survey
(<a href="https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation">Puppet, 2025</a>).<br>A recent survey by Rackspace found that nearly seven in 10 companies (69%) have
moved at least some applications off the cloud and back to on-premise systems or
private clouds
(<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/">ZDNet, 2025</a>).<br>It&#39;s important to note that this doesn&#39;t represent a wholesale abandonment of
cloud computing. Only about 8% of organisations are moving their entire
workloads off the cloud, according to an October 2024 IDC survey
(<a href="https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation">Puppet, 2025</a>). Most are
selectively repatriating specific workloads while maintaining others in the
cloud, resulting in more nuanced, hybrid approaches to IT infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="key-drivers-of-cloud-repatriation">Key Drivers of Cloud Repatriation</h2>
<h3 id="cost-optimisation">Cost Optimisation</h3>
<p>While the cloud initially promised cost savings through reduced capital
expenditure and operational flexibility, many organisations have experienced
what industry experts call &quot;bill shock&quot; as their cloud usage scales. According
to
<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>,
&quot;a Gartner study predicts that through 2024, 60% of infrastructure and
operations leaders will encounter public cloud cost overruns that negatively
impact their on-premises budgets&quot;.<br>This cost concern is particularly relevant for organisations with predictable,
high-volume workloads. According to
<a href="https://www.rsa.com/resources/blog/identity-governance-and-administration/cloud-repatriation-why-enterprise-it-is-returning-from-the-cloud/">RSA</a>,
the company 37Signals announced that its &quot;cloud exit&quot; would save more than $10
million over five years. Similarly, a 2022 report by Andreessen Horowitz found
that repatriation of cloud workloads could reduce cloud bills by 50% or more for
some companies
(<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International, 2023</a>).<br>David Linthicum, a leading consultant and former CTO with Deloitte, attributes
much of this cost issue to technical debt: &quot;<em>They didn&#39;t refactor the
applications to make them more efficient in running on the public cloud
providers. So the public cloud providers, much like if we&#39;re pulling too much
electricity off the grid, just hit them with huge bills to support the
computational and storage needs of those under-optimized applications</em>&quot;
(<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/">ZDNet, 2025</a>).</p>
<h3 id="performance-and-latency">Performance and Latency</h3>
<p>Performance requirements are driving many repatriation decisions, particularly
for applications requiring ultra-low latency. According to
<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>,
&quot;a study by the IEEE found that for certain AI workloads, on-premises GPU
clusters outperformed cloud-based solutions by up to 30% in terms of performance
per dollar&quot;.<br>This performance concern is especially critical in fields like financial
trading, scientific research, and manufacturing where latency can significantly
impact outcomes. As
<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully">ComputerWeekly</a>
notes, &quot;time-sensitive data includes information that users need to access as
rapidly as possible -think financial trading feeds -or where the application is
sensitive to latency&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="security-and-compliance">Security and Compliance</h3>
<p>Security concerns and regulatory compliance requirements are powerful motivators
for cloud repatriation. According to the Rackspace survey cited by
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/">ZDNet</a>,
data security and compliance concerns were the most common reason for
repatriation, cited by 50% of respondents.<br>The implementation of stringent regulations like GDPR has compelled many
organisations to keep certain data within specific geographic boundaries. As
<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>
highlights, &quot;<em>The Data Protection Commission reported a 59% increase in GDPR
complaints in 2022, underscoring the importance of data sovereignty</em>&quot;.<br>Despite cloud providers&#39; significant security investments, many organisations
prefer to maintain direct control over their most sensitive data. According to
<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>,
&quot;<em>a 2023 Thales Cloud Security Study found that 45% of businesses have
experienced a cloud-based data breach or failed audit in the past 12 months,
highlighting ongoing security concerns</em>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="control-and-vendor-lock-in">Control and Vendor Lock-in</h3>
<p>The desire for greater control over hardware and software configurations, along
with concerns about vendor lock-in, are also driving repatriation efforts.
On-premises infrastructure offers more customisation possibilities that may not
be available in public cloud environments.<br>Richard Robbins, founder of TheTechnologyVault.com, observes that &quot;<em>enterprises
don&#39;t like being dependent upon someone else&#39;s cloud infrastructure</em>&quot;
(<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/">ZDNet, 2025</a>).
This concern is particularly acute among regulated industries such as financial
institutions, which are &quot;<em>moving some or all of their web apps from the cloud
back to on-prem or to hybrid setups</em>&quot; due to &quot;vulnerability and downsides to
cloud hosting&quot; that make &quot;executives feel nervous about not having more
control&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="the-emergence-of-balanced-approaches">The Emergence of Balanced Approaches</h2>
<p>Rather than a binary choice between cloud and on-premises, organisations are
increasingly adopting hybrid and multi-cloud approaches that offer the best of
both worlds. This trend allows organisations to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep sensitive or high-performance workloads on-premises</li>
<li>Leverage cloud services for scalability and innovation</li>
<li>Maintain flexibility to adapt to changing business needs</li>
</ul>
<p>According to
<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>,
&quot;<em>The hybrid cloud market is expected to grow from $85.3 billion in 2022 to
$262.4 billion by 2027, according to MarketsandMarkets research</em>&quot;. Similarly,
&quot;<em>Flexera&#39;s 2023 State of the Cloud Report revealed that 71% of enterprises are
pursuing a hybrid cloud strategy, combining public cloud, private cloud, and
on-premises infrastructure</em>&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="personal-cloud-repatriation">Personal Cloud Repatriation</h2>
<p>The repatriation trend isn&#39;t limited to enterprises. Individuals are also
exploring self-hosting options for personal data.<br>For example,
<a href="https://hachyderm.io/@Jeffrey04/114175854454606516">a fediverse user</a> recently
posted about developing a self-hosted photo album application when faced with
cloud storage limitations: &quot;<em>Being an enthusiastic photographer, my partner
captured moments of us together. However, the increasing stack of photos is
accelerating the imminent explosion of my cloud storage</em>&quot;
(<a href="https://kitfucoda.medium.com/a-love-story-in-code-building-my-self-hosted-photo-album-b56a4e89ebdd">KitFu Coda, 2023</a>).
This personal project highlights how individuals with technical skills can
leverage idle hardware to create cost-effective alternatives to cloud storage
services.<br>As
<a href="https://kitfucoda.medium.com/a-love-story-in-code-building-my-self-hosted-photo-album-b56a4e89ebdd">they note</a>,
&quot;<em>Self-hosting your own data is becoming a trend these days, and it is really
not hard to get started</em>&quot;. This trend parallels the enterprise movement, with
individuals seeking greater control, cost savings, and privacy for their
personal data.</p>
<h2 id="planning-for-successful-repatriation">Planning for Successful Repatriation</h2>
<p>For organisations considering cloud repatriation, careful planning is essential.
Key considerations include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Workload Assessment</strong>: Not all workloads benefit equally from repatriation.
<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully">ComputerWeekly</a>
advises that &quot;<em>broadly, repatriation might be the best option where data is
sensitive, time sensitive or expensive to store in the cloud</em>&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Preparation</strong>: Organisations must ensure they have the
physical capacity, networking, power, and cooling capabilities to support
repatriated workloads. According to
<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully">ComputerWeekly</a>,
&quot;<em>a large repatriation project might be a prompt to reorganise the
datacentre, perhaps by moving to newer equipment that can pack more storage
into a single rack or that consumes less power</em>&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Skills Assessment</strong>:
<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully">ComputerWeekly</a>
notes the importance of having &quot;<em>enough staff to provision and manage a
larger system</em>&quot; with the necessary &quot;<em>security and privacy skills needed to
handle sensitive data</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>technical know-how to handle mission-critical,
latency sensitive applications</em>&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proofing</strong>:
<a href="https://www.rsa.com/resources/blog/identity-governance-and-administration/cloud-repatriation-why-enterprise-it-is-returning-from-the-cloud/">RSA</a>
emphasises the importance of maintaining flexibility: &quot;<em>Organizations should
consider the long-term implications of repatriation for their overall IT
strategy. This includes planning for future scalability, considering how
repatriation fits into the broader digital transformation initiatives, and
ensuring that the new infrastructure aligns with long-term business goals</em>&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cloud repatriation represents a maturing perspective on IT infrastructure
strategy rather than a rejection of cloud computing. As organisations gain
experience with cloud environments, they&#39;re becoming more strategic about which
workloads belong where, based on factors like cost, performance, security, and
control.<br>The future likely belongs to balanced, hybrid approaches that leverage the
strengths of both cloud and on-premises infrastructure. As
<a href="https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation">Puppet</a> notes, &quot;<em>Cloud
repatriation is not an endpoint, but rather a strategic tool in the ongoing
evolution of enterprise IT. It empowers organizations to take control of their
digital assets, enhance their security posture, and align their technology
infrastructure with their business objectives</em>&quot;.<br>For both organisations and individuals, the key is making informed decisions
about where and how to deploy IT resources based on specific needs rather than
following blanket &quot;cloud-first&quot; or &quot;on-premises-first&quot; policies. This nuanced
approach to infrastructure strategy will likely characterise the next phase of
digital transformation as the industry moves beyond the initial hype cycles of
cloud adoption.</p>
