        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Leading AI researchers emphasise that success in the field now depends more on engineering skills and adaptability than academic credentials, with the most valuable skills being prioritisation, communication, project selection, and willingness to manually inspect data-suggesting that choosing the right problem can multiply output by 10-100x more effectively than simply working longer hours.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As I was going through some <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs25/">CS25: Transformers United V4</a> lectures from Stanford, I stumbled across some pertinent and useful quotes from guest lecturers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AI is advancing so fast it is hard to keep up. People spend a lot of time and &gt; energy catching up with the latest developments. But not enough attention goes &gt; to the old things. It is more important to <em>study the change itself</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I try to open this [performance] conversation [with my line manager] by asking &gt; &quot;what can I do better&quot;.\ &gt; I tend to use my 1-1s to talk about bigger picture stuff. [...] since that&#39;s &gt; where managers can help the most. Of course, all this [honesty with your &gt; manager] going well is conditional on working in a healthy company and having &gt; a decent manager. [...] do you want to keep working for someone who doesn&#39;t &gt; ask for feedback, or who doesn&#39;t take your problems seriously?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] a friend recently asked me what were the best skills I had. [...] I said &gt; prioritization and communication. These skills are relatively general but &gt; happen to be very important for AI research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to be not a coincidence that some of the strongest leaders in AI who &gt; manage large teams frequently do very low-level technical work.</p>

<h3 id="manually-inspect-data"><a href="https://xcancel.com/_jasonwei/status/1708921475829481683">Manually inspect data</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] great AI researchers are willing to manually inspect lots of data. And &gt; more than that, they build infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect &gt; data quickly. Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable &gt; intuitions about the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] having good health enables clear thinking, which is by far the biggest &gt; leverage in AI. [...] While it&#39;s possible to double output by working twice as &gt; many hours, choosing a better project has the potential to 10x or even 100x &gt; output.</p>
