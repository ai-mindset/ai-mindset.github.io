        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Cloud repatriation-the strategic migration of applications and data from public clouds back to on-premises infrastructure-is gaining traction as organisations seek better cost control, performance, data privacy, and reduced vendor lock-in, with companies like 37signals projecting significant savings whilst maintaining a balanced hybrid approach rather than abandoning cloud entirely.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>More recently, a notable shift is emerging in how organisations approach their cloud infrastructure. Some companies are beginning to move their applications and data away from public cloud providers like AWS, GCP and Azure. This marks a shift in the computing landscape.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-cloud-repatriation-mean">What Does Cloud Repatriation Mean?</h2>
<p>Cloud repatriation refers to the process of moving applications, services and data from public cloud environments back to on-premises data centres, private clouds or hybrid set-ups. This reverse migration represents a pivot from the &quot;cloud-first&quot; mindset that has dominated in the last few years.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-happening">Why It&#39;s Happening</h2>
<p>Several key factors are driving this trend. For larger companies, cost is a real consideration, with scale-ups such as 37signals projecting savings of Â£2 million p.a. by leaving AWS. Performance issues and rising cloud costs have led major organisations like GEICO to reconsider their cloud strategy after experiencing
2.5x increases in their bills alongside reliability challenges. <em>Data privacy</em>,
<em>compliance</em> requirements and the desire to avoid <em>vendor lock-in</em> are also significant motivators aside from growing costs. Many organisations are finding that running certain workloads on-premises or in hybrid environments offers better control over their infrastructure and data. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyJJeik9loU">optimising infrastructure for AI</a> for a nice overview on cloud&lt;-&gt;on-prem.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cloud repatriation isn&#39;t about completely abandoning public clouds but rather about finding the right balance. For organisations with predictable workloads and sufficient technical expertise, a strategic combination of on-premises, private cloud and public cloud infrastructure might prove more effective than a public-cloud-only approach.</p>
