        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> LLMs present unique interpretability challenges due to neurons
exhibiting polysemanticity - responding to multiple unrelated concepts through
superposition - which sparse autoencoders help address by mapping neuron
combinations to specific concepts, enhancing our ability to understand, control,
and improve these increasingly influential AI systems.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly sophisticated, yet
understanding their inner workings remains a critical challenge for AI safety
and development. This blog post summarises concepts and research presented in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGO_Ehywuxc">Welch Labs&#39; video on mechanistic interpretability</a>,
examining how LLMs process information and recent advances in making their
decision-making processes more transparent.</p>
<h2 id="how-llms-think">How LLMs Think</h2>
<p>LLMs process text through a sophisticated pipeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text is converted into tokens and mapped to vectors</li>
<li>These vectors flow through multiple layers via &quot;<em>residual streams</em>&quot;</li>
<li>Each layer transforms the information through attention mechanisms</li>
<li>Final outputs emerge from probability distributions across possible tokens</li>
</ol>
<p>This process, while mathematically precise, creates a black box of neural
connections that resist simple interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge-of-model-transparency">The Challenge of Model Transparency</h2>
<p><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma">Google Gemma</a> models&#39; analysis of the sentence
&quot;<em>the reliability of Wikipedia is very</em>&quot; demonstrates this complexity. The model
assigns varying probabilities to different completions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;<em>important</em>&quot; (20.21%)</li>
<li>&quot;<em>high</em>&quot; (11.16%)</li>
<li>&quot;<em>questionable</em>&quot; (9.48%)</li>
</ul>
<p>These probabilities emerge from intricate interactions between neurons, leading
to a phenomenon called <em>superposition</em>[^1].</p>
<h2 id="superposition-and-its-solution">Superposition and Its Solution</h2>
<p>Unlike vision models where neurons correspond to specific concepts, LLMs exhibit
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01892">polysemanticity</a> -individual neurons respond
to multiple, unrelated concepts. This occurs because LLMs encode more concepts
than available neurons by using specific neuron combinations.</p>
<p>This complexity necessitated the development of [sparse autoencoders]({{
site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2025-01-09-sparse-autoencoders.md %}), which:</p>
<ol>
<li>Map complex neuron combinations to specific concepts</li>
<li>Extract interpretable features from LLMs</li>
<li>Enable direct manipulation of model behaviour</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="practical-implications">Practical Implications</h2>
<p>Understanding LLM internals has crucial implications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Safety</strong>: Better control over model behaviours and outputs</li>
<li><strong>Development</strong>: More targeted improvements in model capabilities</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Enhanced ability to predict and prevent unwanted behaviours</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong>: Greater transparency in AI decision-making processes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While tools like sparse autoencoders have provided unprecedented insights into
model behaviour, they&#39;ve also revealed the vast complexity of LLM internal
mechanisms -the &quot;dark matter&quot; of AI. As these models become more integral to
society, advancing our ability to interpret and control them becomes
increasingly critical for responsible AI development.<br>This improved understanding represents not just academic progress, but a crucial
step toward safer, more reliable AI systems.</p>

    neuron to represent multiple features simultaneously.
