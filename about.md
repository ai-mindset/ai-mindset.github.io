# About

Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Eirini, a Machine Learning Engineer and a proponent of [Just-in-Time learning](https://xcancel.com/radekosmulski/status/1828564396265926967). I favour a minimalist approach to produce environmentally, economically, socially [sustainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability) and robust software. 
Effective computing is accomplished through humility, simplicity, efficiency, streamlined processes, and unified workflows.
