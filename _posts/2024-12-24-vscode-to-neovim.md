## Introduction
Vim's portable `.vimrc` embodies software minimalism at its best. One file, one minute to setup, resulting in a complete development environment. This simplicity served me well until Azure development motivated the use of VSCode.  
While VSCode worked reasonably well on macOS, Fedora revealed its constraints: keyboard input failures, heavy resource usage, and [complex environment portability](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35368889/how-can-i-export-settings) compared to Vim's `vim +PlugInstall`. These limitations drove my search for tools that could maintain simplicity while meeting my development requirements with simplicity and portability in mind.

## Vim -> VSCode -> Neovim
Azure development initially pulled me into VSCode's ecosystem. While stable on macOS, Fedora revealed deal-breakers: random keyboard input failures that only responded to command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P). No amount of configuration resets or reinstalls resolved these issues.

This instability, coupled with VSCode's resource footprint, led me to Neovim. The timing aligned with my exploration of Clojure, where Neovim's Conjure plugin offered a compelling Lisp development experience that rivaled Emacs.

My requirements were specific:
- A lightweight Python IDE
- A lightweight Deno IDE
- A lightweight Clojure IDE

Through [Dialogue Engineering]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-11-15-dialogue-engineering.md %}), I crafted a complete IDE using a [single configuration file](https://github.com/ai-mindset/init.vim). Neovim's mixed ecosystem of package managers and dual Vimscript/Lua support presents a learning curve, but the resulting environment is fast, stable, and precisely tailored to my needs. One minor drawback is the complexity of adding colour to Conjure's output, especially when compared to the rich REPL experiences offered by [IPython](https://ipython.org/), [Deno](https://deno.com/), and Clojure with [rebel-readline](https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline).

## Conclusion
The journey from Vim to VSCode and finally to Neovim reflects a common pattern in software development: sometimes we need to step backward to move forward. While VSCode offered modern IDE features, its stability and resource issues on Linux highlighted the enduring value of minimal, portable tools.  
Neovim strikes an elegant balance: it preserves Vim's philosophy of simplicity and portability while providing modern IDE capabilities. Despite minor challenges with REPL colourisation, its single configuration file approach and robust plugin ecosystem make it a powerful choice for polyglot development. For developers who value both minimal tooling and modern features, Neovim proves that we don't always have to choose between the two.
