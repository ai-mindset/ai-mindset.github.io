**TL;DR:** Model soups provide a computationally efficient ensemble technique by
averaging the weights of similarly trained neural networks, outperforming both
individual models and traditional prediction-averaging ensembles while
maintaining single-model inference speed.

## Introduction

While most ensemble methods in machine learning combine model predictions,
thanks to
[Chris Albon](https://bsky.app/profile/chrisalbon.com/post/3lfbbixka7c25) I
recently learned about an alternative approach called "_model soups_" that works
directly with model parameters. Instead of aggregating outputs, model soups
blend the actual weights and biases of neural networks, showing promising
results in computer vision and language tasks.

## Main Concept

Model soups are created by averaging the parameters (weights and biases) of
multiple independently trained neural networks that share the same architecture
and training setup. For example, if we have three models with weights 2.32,
4.21, and 1.23 for a particular parameter, the "souped" model would use (2.32 +
4.21 + 1.23) / 3 = 2.587 for that parameter. This process is repeated across all
parameters in the network. However, not all parameter combinations lead to
improvements -models typically need similar training datasets, optimisation
methods, and hyperparameters (like learning rate and batch size) to blend
effectively. When done right, parameter-averaged models can outperform both
individual networks and traditional prediction-averaging ensembles, while
maintaining the inference speed of a single model.

## Conclusion

Model soups challenge our intuitions about neural networks by showing that
directly averaging weights can produce better results than averaging
predictions. While the technique requires careful consideration of training
conditions, it provides a computationally efficient way to combine multiple
models into a single network, making it particularly valuable for
resource-constrained production environments where running multiple models in
parallel isn't feasible.
