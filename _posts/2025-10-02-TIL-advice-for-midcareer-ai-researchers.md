**TL;DR:** Leading AI researchers emphasise practical coding skills, early
access to GPUs, building rather than studying, public visibility, finding your
unique perspective, and continuous learning. The most crucial insight: real
breakthroughs come from researchers who ignore consensus, think for themselves,
and tackle hard problems. Most encouragingly, they stress that anyone with
determination can become an expert in this rapidly evolving field.

## Introduction

In a field evolving as rapidly as artificial intelligence, mid-career
researchers often find themselves at a crossroads, balancing established
expertise with the need to adapt to new paradigms. A recent compilation of
advice from leading AI researchers and practitioners offers valuable insights
for navigating this challenging terrain. These perspectives from industry
leaders at organisations like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and others
reveal common themes about what truly matters for success in AI research today -
with surprising emphasis on coding skills, infrastructure knowledge, and the
courage to challenge consensus.

## Key Advice from Industry Leaders

Below is
[a collection of insights](https://xcancel.com/chrisbarber/status/1973405958786429285)
from leading AI researchers and practitioners, in response to the question:
"_What career advice do you have for AI researchers, or what you wish you'd
learned earlier?_":

### Develop Strong Coding Skills

> **[@jeremyphoward](https://xcancel.com/jeremyphoward),
> [@answerdotai](https://xcancel.com/answerdotai),
> [@fastdotai](https://xcancel.com/fastdotai)** Mid-career AI researchers (in
> fact all levels!): focus on becoming really good coders. Learn to replicate
> interesting research papers from scratch. Code is the medium we use to
> experiment, so if you're better at it, you can run more complex and creative
> experiments more quickly.

### Prioritise GPU Access

> **[@jacobmbuckman](https://xcancel.com/jacobmbuckman), Manifest AI** Get as
> close to as many gpus as early as possible. Almost nothing else you could do
> is higher value.

### Build, Don't Just Study

> **[@rronak_](https://xcancel.com/rronak_), Google DeepMind** Stop studying,
> build. Go one layer deeper into the infra than feels comfortable, since that's
> where the value is. If you're on Langchain, write the agent loop yourself; if
> you're on Verl, write the pytorch yourself; If you're on Megatron, write the
> cuda kernels yourself.

### Establish Your Public Presence

> **[@finbarrtimbers](https://xcancel.com/finbarrtimbers), Ai2** People need to
> know you exist to give you opportunities. Write about interesting ideas you
> have or things you are thinking about. There is an extreme hunger for
> "interesting lunch conversation at DeepMind" level content (not hype boi
> threads, not paper level technical).

### Find Your Unique Perspective

> **[@_arohan_](https://xcancel.com/_arohan_), Anthropic**
>
> 1. Perspective matters more than novelty, many so-called 'solved' problems
>    still hide unsolved challenges in the details. Don't dismiss anything as
>    trivial; breakthroughs are hidden in plain sight.
> 2. Don't worry about pedigree or fitting in. Hinton bet on neural networks
>    when the field dismissed them. The real breakthroughs come from researchers
>    who ignore the consensus, think for themselves, and tackle hard problems -
>    and that researcher can be you.

### Invest in Foundational Knowledge

> **[@danielhanchen](https://xcancel.com/danielhanchen), Unsloth AI** I would
> definitely watch MIT, Stanford videos much much earlier -
> [CS231N](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOmsNzYBMe0gJY2XS8AQg16),
> do [FastAI courses](https://course.fast.ai/),
> [MIT's AI course](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI),
> Gilbert Strang's courses +
> [CS229](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLULjW8y9XZKiTBlTFPVDLebgtctNZCgG-).

_Note: For readers interested in Gilbert Strang's courses, some excellent
options include
[MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8),
[Highlights of Calculus](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318),
[MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k),
[A Vision of Linear Algebra](https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61iQEFiWLE21EJCxwmWvvek),
and
[Big Picture of Calculus](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=UcWsDwg1XwM&list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318&index=1)._

### Take Action and Be Selective

> **[@BlackHC](https://xcancel.com/BlackHC), Google DeepMind** Something I tell
> people: Just try and do things, and if you're in a place where you can't
> innovate or learn, figure out whether to switch. Everything compounds, so it
> pays off long-term to be picky. Compromise compensation for role fit if
> necessary. Something I wish I had internalized earlier: When in doubt, double
> down and work hard. Nothing builds confidence and motivation like working
> harder and getting results.

### Connect with the Research Community

> **[@TianbaoX](https://xcancel.com/TianbaoX), OpenAI** I wish I had learned
> earlier how important it is to actively exchange ideas with others and stay
> close to the frontier - AI is a fast-moving field, and working in isolation
> rarely leads to impact. Because scaling laws hold so strongly, incremental
> work often gets washed out; the real breakthroughs come from daring to imagine
> and build something fundamentally new.

### Seek Fulfilling Work

> **[@sandersted](https://xcancel.com/sandersted), OpenAI** If you're unhappy in
> a job, look for a better one.

### Remember Expertise Is Accessible

> **[@rolandgvc](https://xcancel.com/rolandgvc), xAI** You're 2 weeks away from
> catching up to the state of the art. It's never been easier to become an
> expert in anything.

### Stay Adaptable

> **[@angli_ai](https://xcancel.com/angli_ai), Simular AI** The opportunities
> often come from places you couldn't have imagined - stay curious, adapt fast,
> and be willing to reinvent.

### Focus on Legibility

> **[@alexeyguzey](https://xcancel.com/alexeyguzey), OpenAI** To get a job at a
> big company you need to be legible to a big company.

## Conclusion

These insights reveal a significant shift in what drives success in modern AI
research. The traditional academic path has given way to a more hands-on,
build-focused approach where practical skills and independent thinking create
outsized impact.

What's especially hopeful is the democratisation of knowledge underlined in many
of these recommendations, i.e. expertise in AI is more accessible than ever
before, and that anyone with determination can meaningfully contribute
regardless of institutional affiliation.

Perhaps the most compelling theme is the emphasis on challenging established
thinking. This mindset, combined with technical depth and community engagement,
seems to be the true differentiator in today's AI research landscape.
