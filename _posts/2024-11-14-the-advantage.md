## Introduction
Recently I listened to a [successful company's CEO interview](https://saasscalingsecrets.buzzsprout.com/2172375/episodes/15926541-why-slower-growth-could-be-your-fast-track-to-success-with-roan-lavery-ceo-of-freeagent), where he explained how growing sustainably contributed to the company's success. The CEO said that their growth strategy was inspired by [Patrick Lencioni](https://www.tablegroup.com/pat/)'s book [The Advantage](https://www.tablegroup.com/product/the-advantage/). I found the book's premise very interesting, hence I'll attempt to summarise important points as a note to self.   

## Central Thesis
Organisational health is the _single greatest competitive advantage_ a company can achieve, yet it's often overlooked in favour of "smart" business decisions.

## Key components of organisational health
### Leadership team structure
- Optimal size: 3-10 people
- Built on trust and vulnerability
- Values collective success over individual achievement

### Core principles
- Trust and vulnerability as foundations
- Accountability at all levels
- Commitment to collective goals
- Clear communication and expectations

### Operational excellence
- Regular, focused meetings with specific purposes
- Clear distinction between strategic and tactical discussions
- Emphasis on debate and healthy conflict resolution
- Continuous progress monitoring

### People and culture
- Hire for cultural fit rather than training after hiring
- Focus on values alignment in recruitment
- Reward behaviour that aligns with organisational values
- Foster an environment of open communication

### Critical success factors
- Minimal internal politics
- High clarity in communication
- Clear decision-making processes
- Low employee turnover
- High morale and productivity

## Conclusions
The book's fundamental message is that creating a healthy organisation through strong leadership, clear communication, and aligned values is more important than traditional business metrics for long-term success. It's not about being the "smartest" in the market, but about creating the healthiest internal environment.
