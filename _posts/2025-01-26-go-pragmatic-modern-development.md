**TL;DR:** Go offers a refreshingly minimal approach to AI and ML development
with its concise 47-page specification, zero-configuration toolchain, and
functional equivalents to key Python ML libraries - providing explicit error
handling, enforced code consistency, and cross-platform capabilities whilst
reducing cognitive overhead and team friction in production environments.

## Introduction

Modern software development often involves navigating complex toolchains,
opinionated frameworks, and resource-heavy development environments. Many
languages require extensive configuration, multiple runtime dependencies, and
introduce significant cognitive overhead through their vast feature sets and
multiple approaches to solving the same problem. Node.js, JVM languages, and
even Python with its extensive ecosystem can lead to analysis paralysis, code
inhomogeneity and team disagreements over tooling and style.\
Go offers a refreshing alternative. With a language specification under 50
pages, a consolidated toolchain, and a "batteries included" approach, it
provides a low-cognitive-overhead solution for developers seeking simplicity and
productivity. Its zero-config philosophy, coupled with built-in formatting
(`go fmt`), linting[^1] (`go vet`), and testing tools, promotes code uniformity
and reduces team friction over stylistic choices. The sizeable Go community is
centralised, using Slack in this case, which serves as a focal point for
communication, support, networking, and staying informed about the latest
developments.\
While Go may lack a REPL as sophisticated as IPython or the Julia interactive
environment, this limitation encourages proper Test-Driven Development practices
rather than the post-implementation testing often seen in REPL-heavy
environments. Tools like [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go)'s `:GoRun`
and Go Playground provide sufficient interactive development capabilities for
most use cases.\
Below I'm collecting some thoughts on attractive aspects of Go I've discerned so
far and how they compare with other languages I've considered. The list of Go's
features is far from complete, for example I've not mentioned goroutines among
others.

is a very nice curated list of AI-related Go libraries worth checking._

## Development Experience

Go's tooling is exceptional. With [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) in
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/), you get immediate access to formatting, linting,
and code navigation. Unlike JVM languages or JavaScript frameworks that may
require more complex build configurations, Go projects maintain a simple,
predictable structure thanks to `go mod`. The `go fmt` command -triggered on
save by default- enforces consistent code style eliminating debates over
formatting and best practices, while `go vet` catches common mistakes early.

## Error Handling Done Right

Go's approach to error handling initially feels verbose:

```go
result, err := someFunction()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

But this explicitness pays dividends. By treating errors as values that must be
handled, Go forces developers to think about failure cases upfront. The `defer`
keyword complements this by ensuring clean-up code runs regardless of errors:

```go
file, err := os.Open("data.txt")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer file.Close()
```

## ML/AI Capabilities

While Go isn't the primary choice for ML/AI experimentation, its simplicity and
performance make it excellent for production deployments. Its standard library
and growing ecosystem provide solid foundations for numerical computing
([gonum](https://github.com/gonum/gonum)), data processing
([gota](https://github.com/go-gota/gota)), and ML/AI applications
([Gorgonia](https://github.com/gorgonia/gorgonia),
[tfgo](https://github.com/galeone/tfgo),
[gotch](https://github.com/sugarme/gotch)). The language's focus on simplicity
and performance makes it particularly suitable for model serving and inference
workloads.

## Language Design

Go's refreshingly concise specification (under 50 pages) contrasts sharply with
other languages. Even the highly promising Zig, a younger language half of Go's
age, has a 74-page specification despite being positioned as a simpler low-level
language.

Go's intentionally limited feature set and single way of solving problems
promote maintainable, uniform code that's easier to reason about and review, as
reflected in its compact language spec.

For ML engineers and developers seeking a reliable, low-overhead language that
excels at building robust, production-ready applications, Go offers a compelling
choice. While it won't replace Python for rapid prototyping and research, its
simplicity, performance, and consolidated toolchain make it an very compelling
addition to any developer's toolkit.

## Conclusion

To me, Go stands out as a pragmatic choice for modern development through its
key strengths:

- Minimal cognitive overhead with a 47-page specification
- Zero-config toolchain including formatting, testing, and package management
- Centralised community, providing a single-source of truth
- Enforced error handling and clean resource management via `defer`
- Growing ML/AI ecosystem comparable to Python's established libraries
- Cross-platform compilation and efficient garbage collection
- Single, clear way to solve problems, reducing team friction
- Lightweight development environment compared to JVM, .NET, BEAM or Node.js

While Python remains dominant for ML/AI research, prototyping and -frequently-
production, Go excels in production environments where code maintainability,
performance, and team collaboration are crucial. Its intentionally limited
feature set, combined with a comprehensive standard library and maturing ML
ecosystem, makes it a very attractive choice for developers seeking simplicity
without sacrificing capability.\
The language's design philosophy strongly aligns with my needs as a Data
professional looking to reduce tooling complexity and maintain consistent,
reliable codebases. Go's lightweight yet rich toolchain allows writing safe,
efficient AI and data-oriented code based on simplicity and reliability. This
refreshing alternative in today's complex development landscape has strongly
tempted me to start moving my practice to Go's more principled approach.

    Go's [vet doc](https://go.dev/src/cmd/vet/doc.go) _"Vet examines Go source
    code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments
    do not align with the format string. Vet uses heuristics that do not
    guarantee all reports are genuine problems, but it can find errors not
    caught by the compilers."_
