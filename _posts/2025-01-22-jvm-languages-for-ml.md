## Introduction 

While Python dominates the ML landscape due to its extensive ecosystem (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, XGBoost etc.), it presents significant challenges in production environments: dependency management is complex, deployment requires packaging entire Python environments, type safety is optional, and performance often requires rewriting critical paths in C++. JavaScript/TypeScript excel in web deployments but lack robust ML capabilities. Modern JVM languages, particularly Kotlin, address these limitations while offering a unique advantage: the ability to deploy ML solutions across a wide range of platforms without relying on cloud APIs or constant internet connectivity.

These languages enable MLEs (Machine Learning Engineers) to:
- Deploy models on edge devices (IoT, mobile, embedded systems)
- Create standalone desktop applications with embedded ML capabilities
- Run inference locally without API calls or network latency
- Support air-gapped environments where internet access is restricted
- Maintain consistent performance across different platforms
- Leverage platform-specific hardware acceleration

Additionally, these languages provide:
- Superior performance and resource efficiency
- Better concurrency and parallelism support
- Strong typing (Kotlin/Scala) for safer ML pipelines
- Excellent integration with enterprise systems
- Rich ecosystem of battle-tested libraries
- Seamless microservices integration when cloud deployment is needed

For MLEs building production systems where flexibility in deployment options, performance, and offline capabilities are crucial, modern JVM languages with native compilation present a compelling alternative to Python's research-first, often cloud-dependent ecosystem or JavaScript's web-centric approach.

## Native Compilation Capabilities

### Kotlin
- [Kotlin Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html) compiles to LLVM, supporting a wide range of platforms including macOS, iOS, Linux, Windows, and Android NDK
- Strong interoperability with C/C++, Swift, and Objective-C
- Native binaries run without a VM, perfect for edge ML deployment

### Scala 3
- [Scala Native](https://scala-native.org/en/stable/) provides ahead-of-time compilation via LLVM
- Instant startup time with no JVM warmup
- Low-level primitives for performance-critical code
- Seamless C interop through extern objects

### Clojure
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/faq) offers no direct native compilation support[^1]
- Can leverage GraalVM for native image creation
- More JVM-dependent compared to Kotlin and Scala

## Machine Learning Library Ecosystem

### Kotlin
- KotlinDL for deep learning (note: relatively new compared to Python ecosystem)
- Strong integration with TensorFlow and debugging tools
- Excellent interop with Java ML libraries and profiling tools
- Growing ML ecosystem with deeplearning4j support
- Unified development experience through JetBrains ecosystem
- Single governing body (JetBrains) ensuring consistency and quality
- Seamless tooling integration from development to deployment

### Scala 3
- Mature ML ecosystem through Spark MLlib (primarily JVM-based, limited in Native)
- Strong type system helps catch ML pipeline errors early
- Rich ecosystem of testing frameworks (ScalaTest, Specs2)
- Excellent for distributed ML through Spark integration
- Native numerical computing support

### Clojure
- Rich numerical computing capabilities through Java interop
- Exceptional data transformation capabilities with immutable data structures
- Powerful REPL-driven development for rapid ML prototyping
- Limited ML-specific libraries but strong Java ML interop
- Active community focusing on data science tools
- Strong REPL-driven development beneficial for ML experimentation

## Cloud Deployment and Microservices

### Kotlin
- First-class coroutines support for async operations
- Strong adoption in production environments
- Excellent cloud platform support
- Clean Domain-Specific Language (DSL) creation for ML pipelines

### Scala 3
- Strong functional programming patterns for ML pipelines
- Robust type system for safer deployments
- Good cloud support through Scala ecosystems
- Significant compile-time overhead

### Clojure
- Simple deployment through immutable data structures
- Excellent concurrency model through STM (Software Transactional Memory)
- Strong emphasis on data transformation
- Limited type safety for large ML pipelines

## Recommendation

For an MLE focused on end-to-end ML development:

1. **Kotlin** emerges as the strongest choice due to:
   - Native compilation for edge ML deployment
   - Growing ML ecosystem
   - Excellent cloud support
   - Gentle learning curve
   - Production readiness

2. **Scala 3** is a strong second choice if:
   - Working extensively with Spark
   - Need strong type safety
   - Performance is critical
   - Team has some FP (Functional Programming) experience

3. **Clojure** might be suitable if:
   - Focus is on data transformation
   - Team values REPL-driven development[^2]
   - Simplicity is paramount
   - ML deployment is primarily cloud-based

### Conclusion
For a greenfield ML engineering project requiring both cloud and edge deployment, Kotlin provides the best balance of features, ecosystem support, and native compilation capabilities. Its pragmatic approach to functional programming and strong interoperability make it particularly suitable for ML engineering workflows.

[^1]: "_Building a "Clojure native" would require a large amount of work to make a version of Clojure that was slower (probably much slower), less portable, and with significantly less functionality (as the Clojure library relies heavily on the JDK)._"
[^2]: It's worth noting that for the last few years, both [Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html) and [Kotlin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/kotlin-repl.html) have very decent REPLs, alongside the venerable [IPython](https://ipython.org/) interactive environment
