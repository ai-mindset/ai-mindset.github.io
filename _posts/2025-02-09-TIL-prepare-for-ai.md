**TL;DR:** Fast.ai founder Jeremy Howard advocates studying historical technology cycles rather than attempting to predict AI's future, recommending a practical preparation strategy that combines domain expertise with AI capabilities through self-directed learning, side projects, and community engagement- emphasising that success will come from embracing uncertainty whilst pursuing counter-cyclical opportunities.

## Introduction

[Jeremy Howard](https://jeremy.fast.ai/) isn't just another voice in the AI conversation. As the creator of [ULMFiT](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-ulmfit-and-elmo-the-shift-towards-transfer-learning-in-nlp-b5d8e2e3f664) (the algorithm that modern LLMs like ChatGPT are based on), founding researcher at [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/), and [Answer.AI](https://www.answer.ai/), Howard brings a unique perspective shaped by decades at the forefront of AI development. Recently, when [asked about preparing for AI](https://xcancel.com/chrisbarber/status/1888037803566747942), his response wasn't about futuristic predictions or doomsday scenarios. Instead, he offered something more valuable: practical wisdom drawn from historical patterns.

## Why This Matters Now

We're at a critical juncture with AI, similar to where we were with the internet in 1990. Just as the internet transformed every aspect of our lives, AI is poised to do the same. The difference? We can learn from history this time. Howard's insights are particularly valuable because they come from someone who has not only observed but shaped these technological transitions.

## Key Insights on Technology Evolution

Howard emphasises a crucial pattern: technology doesn't just grow linearly. Each innovation follows a "hockey stick" growth curve before flattening into a sigmoid.

More importantly, new "hockey sticks" emerge unexpectedly in different areas. This pattern repeats "like clockwork" making historical understanding more valuable than future predictions.

## Practical Preparation Strategy

Rather than trying to predict AI's future, Howard advocates for:

- Embracing uncertainty while avoiding both dismissive fear and blind hype
- Taking a counter-cyclical approach: pursuing opportunities others overlook
- Investing months in mastering AI tools, accepting initial poor results as part
- Combining AI capabilities with deep domain expertise
- Building practical knowledge through side projects and community engagement
  of the learning process

## The Education Perspective

Howard challenges traditional educational paths, suggesting alternatives:

- Self-directed learning through resources like
- Multiple side hustles to build practical experience
- Community building with like-minded innovators
- Using AI itself to learn technical skills
- Developing both technical and human skills as a generalist

## Conclusion

The key takeaway isn't about predicting AI's future -it's about preparing for it intelligently. Howard's message is: success in the AI era won't come from perfect predictions or traditional career paths. Instead, it will come from practical engagement, continuous learning, and the ability to combine domain expertise with AI capabilities. As he puts it, those who master this combination will have "superpowers" compared to those who don't adapt.\ The most valuable insight? Even AI experts can't predict AI's future reliably. The best strategy is to engage deeply with the technology while maintaining a grounded, practical approach to learning and application. The future belongs to the tinkerers, the experimenters, and those willing to learn from both past and present.
