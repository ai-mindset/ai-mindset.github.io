**TL;DR:** Despite our vastly superior modern technology, antibiotic development
has dramatically declined since the post-WWII "Golden Age" (1940s-1960s) that
produced most antibiotic classes we still use today-highlighting how scientific
capability alone cannot drive progress without three key elements working
together: economic incentives that correct market failures, institutional
coordination, and systematic application of technological tools.

## Introduction

In a thought-provoking analysis[^1], Our World in Data reveals a striking
paradox in medical progress: the most productive period in antibiotic
development occurred in the two decades following World War II, with scientific
capabilities far more limited than today. This "Golden Age of Antibiotics"
(1940s-1960s) produced nearly two-thirds of the antibiotic drug classes we still
rely on[^2].\
Even more surprisingly, since 1970 -despite exponential advances in computing
power and biotechnology- only eight new classes of antibiotics have been
approved[^2]. This indicates a stark decline that threatens the foundation of
modern medicine. Traditional screening methods now rediscover existing compounds
most of the time rather than finding new ones[^3].\
Modern tools like genome sequencing and systematic screening methods offer
unprecedented capabilities. We've only identified a small fraction of bacterial
species, many of which could harbour new antibiotic compounds[^2]. Yet despite
these capabilities, development has stagnated due to fundamental market failures
and fragmented research efforts.\
This article examines this paradoxical inverse relationship between
technological capability and antibiotic development: How did the Golden Age
achieve such remarkable success with limited tools? Why has progress slowed as
our capabilities have grown? Most importantly, what combinations of economic
incentives and modern technology could spark a new era of antibiotic discovery?

## When Urgency Met Innovation

The Golden Age of Antibiotics stands as medicine's most productive period in
antimicrobial discovery, yielding over 20 new antibiotic classes -more than
double what we've developed in the 50 years since[^2]. Three pivotal
breakthroughs, coupled with unprecedented coordination, drove this remarkable
success.\
The foundation was laid by Paul Ehrlich's systematic approach to drug discovery.
By methodically testing hundreds of compounds, he discovered
[salvarsan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsphenamine) in 1910 -the first
synthetic antibiotic that effectively treated syphilis[^2]. A second milestone
emerged when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928. However, the real
innovation came through coordinated wartime effort. With infections being the
second-most common cause of hospital admissions in the US Army, the U.S. Office
of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) launched a global search for more
productive penicillin strains, ultimately finding a high-yielding strain on a
cantaloupe[^4].\
The third breakthrough came from Selman Waksman's insight into soil bacteria.
His discovery that soil-dwelling
[actinomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinomycetales) bacteria
naturally produce antibiotics led to
[streptomycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin)'s development and
opened an entirely new avenue for antibiotic discovery[^5].\
What transformed these breakthroughs into a "golden age" was unprecedented
coordination. The U.S. War Production Board orchestrated collaboration between
government, academia, and industry -removing patent restrictions, sharing data,
and streamlining clinical trials[^6]. The results were remarkable: some
antibiotics, like
[tetracyclines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics) and
[macrolides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide), went from discovery to
clinical use within the same year.

## Scientific Progress and Market Failure

The contrast between the Golden Age and our current era reflects a fundamental
misalignment between public health needs and market incentives[^2]. The market
structure fundamentally disfavours antibiotics in two ways:

1. Revenue Structure: While chronic disease medications can generate billions in
   annual revenue over decades, new antibiotics typically generate only tens of
   millions annually[^7], by comparison. This revenue gap has driven many large
   pharmaceutical companies away from antibiotic development[^8].
2. Conservation Requirements: New antibiotics must be reserved for severe
   drug-resistant infections, reaching less than 1% of hospitalised
   patients[^7]. This necessary conservation practice severely limits market
   potential.

Meanwhile, our technological capabilities offer three particularly promising
approaches:

1. Genome mining: a breakthrough technique that identifies hidden antibiotic
   genes in microbes that remain dormant under standard laboratory conditions.
   This computational approach has already yielded promising candidates like
   humimycins[^9].
2. Advanced bacterial exploration: research into extreme environments like deep
   oceans and deserts, where previously "unculturable" bacteria might harbour
   entirely new antibiotic classes[^3].
3. Smart combination strategies: exploiting the observation that bacterial
   resistance to one antibiotic can increase vulnerability to others, opening
   new therapeutic possibilities[^10].

Yet these powerful tools remain underutilised due to insufficient investment and
coordination. The challenge isn't scientific capability -it's the failure to
create systems that effectively deploy these technologies within sustainable
economic frameworks.

## Integrating Economics and Technology

Drawing from evidence in antibiotic development research, several promising
approaches could help overcome current market failures while leveraging modern
technological capabilities[^7].

### Economic Solutions to Market Failures

1. Subscription Models: The UK has pioneered a system where healthcare systems
   pay annual fees for antibiotic access rather than per-volume pricing. This
   addresses both the revenue challenge and conservation requirements by
   providing stable income while supporting appropriate antibiotic use[^7].
2. Advance Market Commitments: These provide guaranteed payments to companies
   that successfully develop new antibiotics, similar to successful vaccine
   development programs. This directly addresses the revenue uncertainty that
   has driven companies away from antibiotic development[^11].
3. Collaborative Funding Initiatives: Organisations like CARB-X and GARDP help
   smaller companies navigate costly clinical trials, distributing development
   risks that large pharmaceutical companies are unwilling to bear[^7].

### Leveraging Modern Technology

To maximise the impact of these economic incentives, three technological
approaches show particular promise:

1. Systematic Genome Mining: Using computational power to identify promising
   antibiotic-producing genes in bacterial genomes, revealing compounds that
   traditional screening would miss[^9].
2. Environmental Exploration: Research into extreme environments could unlock
   entirely new antibiotic classes, enabled by modern sequencing
   technologies[^3].
3. Smart Combination Strategies: Systematic exploration of how resistance to one
   antibiotic can increase vulnerability to others, offering new therapeutic
   possibilities[^10].

## Conclusion

The story of antibiotic development demonstrates that scientific capability
alone cannot drive progress. The Golden Age succeeded through a powerful
combination of systematic approaches, unprecedented collaboration, and removal
of institutional barriers -even with limited technological tools[^2].\
Today's challenge is fundamentally different. We possess sophisticated tools
-from genome mining to advanced screening methods- yet development has stalled.
This paradox reveals that progress requires three key elements working in
concert: economic incentives, institutional coordination, and technological
application[^7].\
The evidence-based solutions presented in the original Our World in Data article[^1]
offer a path forward. Market reforms like subscription models and advance market
commitments could help correct the fundamental economic misalignment in
antibiotic development[^8]. Meanwhile, systematic application of computational
tools, genomic analysis, and bacterial exploration could help unlock new classes
of antibiotics that traditional methods miss[^9].\
The urgency is clear. Antimicrobial resistance threatens to undermine many
advances in modern medicine[^12]. However, by combining proven coordination
approaches from the Golden Age with modern capabilities and sustainable economic
frameworks, we can revitalise antibiotic development for the challenges ahead.
