## Introduction
I recently watched a lively presentation titled [opinionated onboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og7NzaVpceE), that discussed the dramatic impact of onboarding practices on new staff and business success. The speaker, drawing from his experience, articulated that poor onboarding is actively harming companies while good onboarding can transform team productivity and retention.
Having experienced both ends of the spectrum myself, I strongly agree with the presenter's central thesis. Companies can't afford to waste months getting new staff up to speed, yet that's what's happening very frequently. The costs are staggering, both in lost productivity and squandered talent.

## The Problem
New employees face an overwhelming cognitive burden as they simultaneously navigate multiple learning curves: mastering the tech stack, deciphering an unfamiliar codebase, adapting to team workflows, understanding the business domain, and learning organisational structures. Many companies worsen this situation through ineffective approaches, either expecting staff to self-direct their learning with vague instructions like "go learn X and tell us when you're done", or by immediately assigning them tickets without proper context or support. This inefficiency comes at a significant cost though. According to the presenter, the average software developer staying at a company for only 20 months, taking 6 months to become productive means losing nearly a third of their effective tenure[^1]. Rather than fixing their onboarding processes, many companies respond by exclusively hiring senior professionals who can "hit the ground running" - an approach that not only limits their talent pool but proves unrealistic even for experienced hires.

## Effective On-boarding Strategies
According to the presenter, research and experience show that effective onboarding follows clear cognitive science principles. Rather than overwhelming new hires with broad, unfocused (occasionally learning) objectives, successful onboarding programs recognise how human learning actually works and structure their approach accordingly. Two key principles emerge as foundational to any effective onboarding strategy:

1. Focus on building specific capabilities rather than general "understanding"
2. Account for cognitive limitations:
    - People can only hold ~4 concepts in working memory
    - New concepts take more mental space than familiar ones
    - Skills must be practiced close to when they're learned

### Best Practices
These principles translate into concrete best practices that any organisation can implement. While the specific skills and technologies may vary between teams, successful onboarding programs share common structural elements that maximize learning efficiency while minimizing cognitive overload:

- **Break down complex skills into smaller, manageable components**. For example, rather than asking someone to "learn LiveView"[^2] break it down into specific tasks like creating forms, handling events, or managing state 
- **Provide structured learning paths rather than self-directed exploration**. When new hires must decide what to learn next, they waste valuable mental capacity on planning rather than learning. A clear, predefined path eliminates this overhead 
- **Aim for 80% proficiency before moving to next skill**. This threshold ensures sufficient mastery while avoiding diminishing returns from pursuing perfection 
- **Define minimum productive competency for the role**. Not every skill needs to be mastered immediately - identify what's truly needed for day-one productivity and focus there first 
- **Use checklists and frequent practice with feedback**. Clear checkpoints provide motivation and progress tracking, while regular feedback prevents learners from developing incorrect habits 
- **Focus on mechanical competency to reduce cognitive load**. When basic operations become automatic, developers can focus their mental energy on solving more complex problems 

## Conclusion
Effective onboarding is not just a nice-to-have, it's a competitive necessity in today's software industry. While poor onboarding practices continue to cost companies valuable time and talent, the path to improvement is clear. By _breaking down_ complex skills, providing _structured learning_ paths, and _respecting_ cognitive limitations, organisations can dramatically reduce the time it takes for new hires to become productive team members. This investment in structured onboarding not only accelerates developer productivity but also expands hiring possibilities, allowing companies to tap into a broader talent pool. The choice is simple: continue losing months of productivity to ineffective onboarding, or implement these evidence-based practices to build stronger, more capable engineering teams.

Also, the tenure statistic may be skewed towards the U.S. market, however it's true that many employees job hop in pursuit of a higher salary or a better job altogether
