**TL;DR:** Sheena Iyengar's cross-cultural research reveals that how we perceive and respond to choice varies dramatically between societies- with evidence showing that sometimes having fewer choices or allowing others to choose for us can lead to better outcomes, challenging the widely-held Western belief that more individual choice is always beneficial.

## Introduction

Today I revisited a talk on [the art of choosing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDq9-QxvsNU) by Sheena Iyengar. A humourous and informative presentation, it reminded me that our assumptions about choice –as studied by Prof. Iyengar through research spanning American, European and Asian populations– reveals fascinating cultural differences in how we perceive and respond to choice. Her research reveals some eye-opening insights that I'll briefly summarise below.

## Perceiving Choice

First, while Americans believe individual choice is sacred (think "have it your way"), research shows this isn't universal. When studying children solving puzzles, Asian-American children actually performed better when their mothers chose for them, while Anglo-American children did better choosing for themselves. This reveals how deeply cultural context shapes not just our preferences, but the actual effectiveness of our choices.

Second, remember how overwhelming it feels staring at 50 different breakfast cereals? Turns out, people from post-communist countries often saw seven different sodas as just one choice: "soda or no soda." This isn't because they're less sophisticated, it's because the ability to spot tiny differences between products is a learned skill -not a natural one.

Most striking was the research on medical decisions. When comparing American and French parents making end-of-life decisions for infants, American parents had more negative emotions and guilt despite insisting on having the choice, while French parents, whose doctors made the decisions, coped better. This challenges the core American belief that having choice is always better.

Concluding with a personal story, Prof. Iyengar -who is blind- shared how she once brought two "clearly different" shades of pink nail polish to her lab. When she removed the labels, half the participants couldn't tell them apart. Those who could, chose differently when the labels were present versus absent, showing how marketing narratives shape what we think we're choosing.

## Conclusion

The TL;DR is: Through cross-cultural research, Prof. Iyengar shows that how we understand and value choice varies dramatically across cultures. Sometimes, having fewer choices or letting others choose for us might actually lead to better outcomes.\ As a technologist, inundated with a very wide choice of tools that often offer similar results, I have made the conscious decision to reduce my tooling footprint to the minimum viable toolstack possible. I'm happy to let more knowledgeable professionals choose, with _adequate justification_, tools for my line of work but I do disagree with the zealotry that's occasionally observed in tech and complemented by big egos.
