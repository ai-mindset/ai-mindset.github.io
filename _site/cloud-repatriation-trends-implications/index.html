<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The last decade has witnessed the meteoric rise of cloud computing, with organisations large and small migrating their data, applications, and infrastructure to public cloud environments. The promises were compelling: reduced capital expenditure, unlimited scalability, enhanced flexibility, and access to cutting-edge technologies without the overhead of managing physical infrastructure. However, a notable countertrend has emerged in recent years ‚Äì cloud repatriation. This phenomenon, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúreverse cloud migration,‚Äù involves moving workloads, applications, and data back from public cloud environments to on-premises data centres, private clouds, or hybrid setups (<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International, 2023</a>). I‚Äôve previously explored this topic in my article <a href="/cloud-repatriation/">The On-Prem Comeback (aka Cloud Repatriation)</a>, where I introduced the basic concepts and early examples of this trend.<br />
This article explores the growing cloud repatriation movement, examining why organisations and individuals are reconsidering their cloud-first strategies, the key drivers behind these decisions, and how they‚Äôre implementing these transitions to achieve more balanced and optimised IT infrastructures.</p>

<h2 id="the-scale-of-the-cloud-repatriation-movement">The Scale of the Cloud Repatriation Movement</h2>

<p>The repatriation trend is not isolated but represents a significant shift in how organisations approach their IT infrastructure strategy. According to a 2021 survey by IDC cited by <a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>, 80% of organisations reported repatriating workloads or data from public cloud environments. More recent data from the end of 2024 showed that 86% of CIOs planned to move some public cloud workloads back to private cloud or on-premises ‚Äì the highest on record for the Barclays CIO Survey (<a href="https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation">Puppet, 2025</a>).<br />
A recent survey by Rackspace found that nearly seven in 10 companies (69%) have moved at least some applications off the cloud and back to on-premise systems or private clouds (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/">ZDNet, 2025</a>).<br />
It‚Äôs important to note that this doesn‚Äôt represent a wholesale abandonment of cloud computing. Only about 8% of organisations are moving their entire workloads off the cloud, according to an October 2024 IDC survey (<a href="https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation">Puppet, 2025</a>). Most are selectively repatriating specific workloads while maintaining others in the cloud, resulting in more nuanced, hybrid approaches to IT infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="key-drivers-of-cloud-repatriation">Key Drivers of Cloud Repatriation</h2>

<h3 id="cost-optimisation">Cost Optimisation</h3>

<p>While the cloud initially promised cost savings through reduced capital expenditure and operational flexibility, many organisations have experienced what industry experts call ‚Äúbill shock‚Äù as their cloud usage scales. According to <a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>, ‚Äúa Gartner study predicts that through 2024, 60% of infrastructure and operations leaders will encounter public cloud cost overruns that negatively impact their on-premises budgets‚Äù.<br />
This cost concern is particularly relevant for organisations with predictable, high-volume workloads. According to <a href="https://www.rsa.com/resources/blog/identity-governance-and-administration/cloud-repatriation-why-enterprise-it-is-returning-from-the-cloud/">RSA</a>, the company 37Signals announced that its ‚Äòcloud exit‚Äô would save more than $10 million over five years. Similarly, a 2022 report by Andreessen Horowitz found that repatriation of cloud workloads could reduce cloud bills by 50% or more for some companies (<a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International, 2023</a>).<br />
David Linthicum, a leading consultant and former CTO with Deloitte, attributes much of this cost issue to technical debt: ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt refactor the applications to make them more efficient in running on the public cloud providers. So the public cloud providers, much like if we‚Äôre pulling too much electricity off the grid, just hit them with huge bills to support the computational and storage needs of those under-optimized applications‚Äù (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/">ZDNet, 2025</a>).</p>

<h3 id="performance-and-latency">Performance and Latency</h3>

<p>Performance requirements are driving many repatriation decisions, particularly for applications requiring ultra-low latency. According to <a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>, ‚Äúa study by the IEEE found that for certain AI workloads, on-premises GPU clusters outperformed cloud-based solutions by up to 30% in terms of performance per dollar‚Äù.<br />
This performance concern is especially critical in fields like financial trading, scientific research, and manufacturing where latency can significantly impact outcomes. As <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully">ComputerWeekly</a> notes, ‚Äútime-sensitive data includes information that users need to access as rapidly as possible ‚Äì think financial trading feeds ‚Äì or where the application is sensitive to latency‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="security-and-compliance">Security and Compliance</h3>

<p>Security concerns and regulatory compliance requirements are powerful motivators for cloud repatriation. According to the Rackspace survey cited by <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/">ZDNet</a>, data security and compliance concerns were the most common reason for repatriation, cited by 50% of respondents. <br />
The implementation of stringent regulations like GDPR has compelled many organisations to keep certain data within specific geographic boundaries. As <a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a> highlights, ‚ÄúThe Data Protection Commission reported a 59% increase in GDPR complaints in 2022, underscoring the importance of data sovereignty‚Äù.<br />
Despite cloud providers‚Äô significant security investments, many organisations prefer to maintain direct control over their most sensitive data. According to <a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>, ‚Äúa 2023 Thales Cloud Security Study found that 45% of businesses have experienced a cloud-based data breach or failed audit in the past 12 months, highlighting ongoing security concerns‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="control-and-vendor-lock-in">Control and Vendor Lock-in</h3>

<p>The desire for greater control over hardware and software configurations, along with concerns about vendor lock-in, are also driving repatriation efforts. On-premises infrastructure offers more customisation possibilities that may not be available in public cloud environments.<br />
Richard Robbins, founder of TheTechnologyVault.com, observes that ‚Äúenterprises don‚Äôt like being dependent upon someone else‚Äôs cloud infrastructure‚Äù (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-some-companies-are-backing-away-from-the-public-cloud/">ZDNet, 2025</a>). This concern is particularly acute among regulated industries such as financial institutions, which are ‚Äúmoving some or all of their web apps from the cloud back to on-prem or to hybrid setups‚Äù due to ‚Äúvulnerability and downsides to cloud hosting‚Äù that make ‚Äúexecutives feel nervous about not having more control‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-balanced-approaches">The Emergence of Balanced Approaches</h2>

<p>Rather than a binary choice between cloud and on-premises, organisations are increasingly adopting hybrid and multi-cloud approaches that offer the best of both worlds. This trend allows organisations to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep sensitive or high-performance workloads on-premises</li>
  <li>Leverage cloud services for scalability and innovation</li>
  <li>Maintain flexibility to adapt to changing business needs</li>
</ul>

<p>According to <a href="https://blog.trginternational.com/cloud-repatriation-business-return-on-premises">TRG International</a>, ‚ÄúThe hybrid cloud market is expected to grow from $85.3 billion in 2022 to $262.4 billion by 2027, according to MarketsandMarkets research‚Äù. Similarly, ‚ÄúFlexera‚Äôs 2023 State of the Cloud Report revealed that 71% of enterprises are pursuing a hybrid cloud strategy, combining public cloud, private cloud, and on-premises infrastructure‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="personal-cloud-repatriation">Personal Cloud Repatriation</h2>

<p>The repatriation trend isn‚Äôt limited to enterprises. Individuals are also exploring self-hosting options for personal data.<br />
For example, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@Jeffrey04/114175854454606516">a fediverse user</a> recently posted about developing a self-hosted photo album application when faced with cloud storage limitations: ‚ÄúBeing an enthusiastic photographer, my partner captured moments of us together. However, the increasing stack of photos is accelerating the imminent explosion of my cloud storage‚Äù (<a href="https://kitfucoda.medium.com/a-love-story-in-code-building-my-self-hosted-photo-album-b56a4e89ebdd">KitFu Coda, 2023</a>). This personal project highlights how individuals with technical skills can leverage idle hardware to create cost-effective alternatives to cloud storage services.<br />
As <a href="https://kitfucoda.medium.com/a-love-story-in-code-building-my-self-hosted-photo-album-b56a4e89ebdd">they note</a>, ‚ÄúSelf-hosting your own data is becoming a trend these days, and it is really not hard to get started‚Äù. This trend parallels the enterprise movement, with individuals seeking greater control, cost savings, and privacy for their personal data.</p>

<h2 id="planning-for-successful-repatriation">Planning for Successful Repatriation</h2>

<p>For organisations considering cloud repatriation, careful planning is essential. Key considerations include:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Workload Assessment</strong>: Not all workloads benefit equally from repatriation. <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully">ComputerWeekly</a> advises that ‚Äúbroadly, repatriation might be the best option where data is sensitive, time sensitive or expensive to store in the cloud‚Äù.</li>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure Preparation</strong>: Organisations must ensure they have the physical capacity, networking, power, and cooling capabilities to support repatriated workloads. According to <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully">ComputerWeekly</a>, ‚Äúa large repatriation project might be a prompt to reorganise the datacentre, perhaps by moving to newer equipment that can pack more storage into a single rack or that consumes less power‚Äù.</li>
  <li><strong>Skills Assessment</strong>: <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Cloud-repatriation-How-to-do-it-successfully">ComputerWeekly</a> notes the importance of having ‚Äúenough staff to provision and manage a larger system‚Äù with the necessary ‚Äúsecurity and privacy skills needed to handle sensitive data‚Äù and ‚Äútechnical know-how to handle mission-critical, latency sensitive applications‚Äù.</li>
  <li><strong>Future-Proofing</strong>: <a href="https://www.rsa.com/resources/blog/identity-governance-and-administration/cloud-repatriation-why-enterprise-it-is-returning-from-the-cloud/">RSA</a> emphasises the importance of maintaining flexibility: ‚ÄúOrganizations should consider the long-term implications of repatriation for their overall IT strategy. This includes planning for future scalability, considering how repatriation fits into the broader digital transformation initiatives, and ensuring that the new infrastructure aligns with long-term business goals‚Äù.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Cloud repatriation represents a maturing perspective on IT infrastructure strategy rather than a rejection of cloud computing. As organisations gain experience with cloud environments, they‚Äôre becoming more strategic about which workloads belong where, based on factors like cost, performance, security, and control.<br />
The future likely belongs to balanced, hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both cloud and on-premises infrastructure. As <a href="https://www.puppet.com/blog/cloud-repatriation">Puppet</a> notes, ‚ÄúCloud repatriation is not an endpoint, but rather a strategic tool in the ongoing evolution of enterprise IT. It empowers organizations to take control of their digital assets, enhance their security posture, and align their technology infrastructure with their business objectives‚Äù.<br />
For both organisations and individuals, the key is making informed decisions about where and how to deploy IT resources based on specific needs rather than following blanket ‚Äúcloud-first‚Äù or ‚Äúon-premises-first‚Äù policies. This nuanced approach to infrastructure strategy will likely characterise the next phase of digital transformation as the industry moves beyond the initial hype cycles of cloud adoption.</p>
